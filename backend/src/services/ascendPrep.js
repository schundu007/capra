CRITICAL JD ALIGNMENT:
- Carefully analyze the JOB DESCRIPTION to identify the TOP 3-4 required skills/experiences
- From the RESUME, find specific achievements that DIRECTLY match those JD requirements
- Every achievement mentioned MUST tie back to a JD requirement
- Use keywords and terminology from the JD
- If the JD mentions specific tech (AWS, Python, etc.), highlight matching experience

CRITICAL: The pitch must be SPEAKABLE - write it as if the candidate will READ IT OUT LOUD to the interviewer.
- Use conversational language, not bullet points of facts
- Write complete sentences that flow naturally when spoken
- Include natural transitions between sections
- Make it personal and authentic, not robotic

Structure as 5 SECTIONS (each section = what to SAY, not notes about what to say):

1. OPENING HOOK (15-20 seconds) - A confident intro that mentions skills MATCHING the JD
2. KEY ACHIEVEMENT #1 (30-40 seconds) - Tell a mini-story about an accomplishment that DIRECTLY matches a JD requirement
3. KEY ACHIEVEMENT #2 (30-40 seconds) - Another example that matches a DIFFERENT JD requirement
4. WHY THIS COMPANY (20-30 seconds) - Genuine enthusiasm for THIS specific company and role
5. CLOSING (10-15 seconds) - Summarize how your skills match THEIR specific needs

Each section should have 2-4 SPEAKABLE sentences (not bullet points).

Analyze the document thoroughly and extract ALL meaningful content from it.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. EXTRACT ALL UNIQUE QUESTIONS from the document - do NOT summarize or skip any
2. REMOVE DUPLICATES: If the same question appears multiple times (even with slight wording differences), include it ONLY ONCE
3. FILTER OUT NONSENSE: Skip any malformed text, incomplete sentences, or gibberish content
4. QUALITY CHECK: Each question must be:
   - A complete, coherent question
   - Actually answerable (not truncated or corrupted)
   - Relevant to the document's topic
5. If the document contains 30 unique questions, you MUST include all 30
6. Provide detailed answers for EVERY valid question found

DUPLICATE DETECTION:
- Questions asking the same thing with different wording = DUPLICATE (keep only one)
- Questions with identical meaning = DUPLICATE
- Questions that are subsets of other questions = keep the more comprehensive one

FILTERING CRITERIA (skip these):
- Incomplete sentences or partial text
- Random characters or formatting artifacts
- Headers/footers/page numbers
- Table of contents entries without actual content
- Copyright notices or metadata
