      description: 'Foundation of most coding interviews. Master array manipulation and hash map usage.',

      introduction: `Arrays and Hash Maps are the foundation of nearly every coding interview. Understanding these data structures deeply will help you solve 40-50% of all LeetCode problems.

**Why This Matters:**
- Arrays provide O(1) random access and are the basis for most algorithms
- Hash Maps (dictionaries) provide O(1) average lookup, insertion, and deletion
- Together, they let you reduce O(n²) brute force solutions to O(n)

**Key Insight:** When you see a problem requiring "find if X exists" or "count occurrences," your first thought should be hash maps.`,

      whenToUse: [
        'Need O(1) lookup for previously seen elements (Two Sum pattern)',
        'Counting frequency of elements (anagram, character counting)',
        'Finding duplicates or unique elements',
        'Need to remember "what you\'ve seen so far" while iterating',
        'Grouping elements by some property (Group Anagrams)',
        'Need range sum queries (Prefix Sums)'

      timeComplexity: 'O(n) average with hash maps',
      spaceComplexity: 'O(n) for hash map storage',

      approach: [
        'Identify what you need to track: indices, counts, or previous values',
        'Choose the right key-value mapping: value→index, value→count, or transformed_value→list',
        'Decide if you need one pass (build + query simultaneously) or two passes (build then query)',
        'Handle edge cases: empty array, single element, all duplicates',
        'Consider if sorting helps (often O(n log n) is acceptable)'

        // Junior
        { question: 'What is an array?', difficulty: 'Easy', answer: 'An array is a contiguous block of memory storing elements of the same type, accessible by index in O(1) time. Elements are stored sequentially, enabling direct memory address calculation: address = base + (index × element_size).' },
        { question: 'Explain the concept of an array index.', difficulty: 'Easy', answer: 'An array index is a zero-based (in most languages) integer that identifies an element\'s position. It maps directly to memory offset, enabling O(1) random access. Index bounds are [0, length-1]; accessing outside causes undefined behavior or exceptions.' },
        { question: 'What is the time complexity of accessing an element in an array?', difficulty: 'Easy', answer: 'O(1) constant time. The memory address is calculated directly: base_address + (index × element_size). This is why arrays excel at random access compared to linked lists which require O(n) traversal.' },
        { question: 'How do you find the length of an array in various programming languages?', difficulty: 'Easy', answer: 'Python: len(arr), JavaScript: arr.length, Java: arr.length, C++: sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]) for static arrays or vector.size(), Go: len(arr). Dynamic languages store length as metadata; C requires manual tracking.' },
        { question: 'What are the limitations of arrays?', difficulty: 'Easy', answer: 'Fixed size (static arrays), expensive insertion/deletion O(n), contiguous memory requirement (fragmentation issues), homogeneous types only, no built-in bounds checking in C/C++, and memory waste if allocated size exceeds usage.' },
        { question: 'What is a slice operation in the context of arrays, and how is it useful?', difficulty: 'Easy', answer: 'A slice extracts a subarray using start:end notation (e.g., arr[1:4]). It creates a view or copy of elements in range [start, end). Useful for processing portions of data, implementing sliding windows, and avoiding manual index loops.' },
        { question: 'Explain the concept of a dynamic array.', difficulty: 'Easy', answer: 'A dynamic array (ArrayList, vector, list) automatically resizes when capacity is exceeded. It doubles capacity on overflow (amortized O(1) append), copies elements to new memory, and provides O(1) random access with flexible sizing. Examples: Python list, Java ArrayList, C++ vector.' },
        // Mid
        { question: 'What is a two-dimensional array, and how is it different from a regular array?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'A 2D array is an array of arrays, creating a matrix structure accessed via two indices: arr[row][col]. Stored in row-major (C, Python) or column-major (Fortran) order. Used for grids, matrices, and graph adjacency matrices. Memory layout affects cache performance.' },
        { question: 'What is the difference between an array and a linked list?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Arrays: O(1) access, O(n) insert/delete, contiguous memory, better cache locality. Linked Lists: O(n) access, O(1) insert/delete at known position, non-contiguous memory, extra pointer overhead. Choose arrays for random access; linked lists for frequent insertions.' },
        { question: 'How can you reverse the elements of an array in-place?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Use two pointers at start and end, swap elements, move pointers inward until they meet. Time: O(n), Space: O(1). Code: for i in range(len(arr)//2): arr[i], arr[n-1-i] = arr[n-1-i], arr[i]. This is the optimal in-place solution.' },
        { question: 'What are some common use cases for arrays in software development?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Storing collections (users, products), implementing stacks/queues, matrix operations, lookup tables, buffers for I/O, image pixel data, hash table buckets, dynamic programming memoization, and as building blocks for other data structures.' },
        { question: 'What is the difference between a static array and a dynamic array?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Static arrays have compile-time fixed size allocated on stack (faster but limited). Dynamic arrays resize at runtime, allocated on heap, with amortized O(1) append via capacity doubling. Trade-off: static is faster but inflexible; dynamic handles unknown sizes.' },
        { question: 'Explain the concept of a sparse array.', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'A sparse array has mostly zero/default values. Instead of storing all elements, use a hash map {index: value} or coordinate list. Saves memory from O(n) to O(k) where k is non-zero count. Used in sparse matrices, document-term matrices, and graph adjacency.' },
        { question: 'What is a jagged array, and how is it different from a regular two-dimensional array?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'A jagged array has rows of varying lengths (array of arrays with different sizes). Unlike rectangular 2D arrays where all rows have equal length, jagged arrays save memory for non-uniform data. Example: representing a triangle where row i has i+1 elements.' },
        { question: 'How can you find the maximum and minimum elements in an array efficiently?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Single pass O(n): track min and max while iterating. Optimized: compare pairs, reducing comparisons from 2n to 3n/2. Use min/max heap for streaming data. For sorted arrays, min=arr[0], max=arr[n-1]. Built-in: max(arr), min(arr) in Python.' },
        { question: 'What is the concept of a circular array, and why might it be useful?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'A circular array wraps around using modulo: index % length. Useful for circular buffers, round-robin scheduling, implementing circular queues with O(1) operations, and problems like "maximum sum circular subarray". Eliminates need for shifting elements.' },
        { question: 'What are some potential challenges with cache locality when working with large arrays?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Non-sequential access causes cache misses. Row-major vs column-major mismatch hurts performance. Large arrays may not fit in cache. Solutions: access sequentially, use blocking/tiling for matrices, prefer row-wise iteration in C/Python, consider cache line size (64 bytes).' },
        { question: 'How can you find the intersection of two arrays efficiently?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Hash set approach O(n+m): add smaller array to set, check larger array against it. Sorted arrays: two pointers O(n+m) after O(n log n) sort. For frequent queries, sort once then binary search. Handle duplicates by using Counter/multiset.' },
        { question: 'What are some common mistakes or pitfalls to avoid when working with arrays?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Off-by-one errors (bounds), modifying array while iterating, forgetting zero-indexing, integer overflow in index calculations, shallow vs deep copy confusion, not handling empty arrays, assuming sorted input, and memory leaks with dynamic allocation.' },
        { question: 'Explain the concept of a multidimensional array. How does it differ from a two-dimensional array?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Multidimensional arrays extend beyond 2D: 3D for volumetric data (x,y,z), 4D for video (x,y,z,time), nD for tensors in ML. Accessed via multiple indices arr[i][j][k]. Memory grows exponentially with dimensions. Flatten to 1D for storage optimization.' },
        { question: 'What is the difference between an array and a list in Python?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Python list: dynamic, heterogeneous types, built-in methods, slower. array.array: homogeneous types, more memory efficient, faster numeric operations. NumPy array: optimized for numerical computing, vectorized operations, broadcasting. Use list for general purpose; arrays for performance-critical numeric work.' },
        { question: 'How can you efficiently remove duplicate elements from an unsorted array?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Hash set O(n): seen = set(); result = [x for x in arr if not (x in seen or seen.add(x))]. Preserves order. Alternative: sort first O(n log n) then remove adjacent duplicates. For sorted arrays: two-pointer in-place O(n). Trade-off between time, space, and order preservation.' },
        { question: 'What is a rolling array or sliding window in the context of array manipulation?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Rolling array: reuse array space in DP by keeping only necessary previous states (e.g., dp[i%2] instead of dp[i]). Sliding window: maintain a window [left, right] that moves through array for subarray problems. Both optimize space to O(1) or O(k) from O(n).' },
        // Senior
        { question: 'What are the benefits and drawbacks of using arrays in low-level systems programming?', difficulty: 'Hard', answer: 'Benefits: predictable memory layout, cache efficiency, zero overhead, direct hardware mapping, DMA compatibility. Drawbacks: manual memory management, buffer overflows, no bounds checking, fragmentation with large allocations, fixed size limitations. Critical for embedded systems, drivers, and performance-critical code.' },
        { question: 'Explain the concept of a bit array or bitset. How is it different from a regular array?', difficulty: 'Hard', answer: 'A bit array stores boolean values as individual bits, using 8x less memory than byte arrays. Operations use bitwise AND/OR/XOR. Used for Bloom filters, prime sieves, set membership, and flags. Access: (arr[i/8] >> (i%8)) & 1. Trade-off: more CPU ops for memory savings.' },
        { question: 'How do you implement a resizable array (dynamic array) from scratch?', difficulty: 'Hard', answer: 'Maintain array, size, and capacity. On append: if size == capacity, allocate 2x capacity array, copy elements, free old array. Amortized O(1) append proven via aggregate analysis. Shrink at 1/4 capacity to avoid thrashing. Handle edge cases: empty, single element, capacity overflow.' },
        { question: 'Explain the concept of a circular buffer and its applications.', difficulty: 'Hard', answer: 'A circular buffer uses fixed-size array with head/tail pointers wrapping via modulo. O(1) enqueue/dequeue without shifting. Applications: producer-consumer queues, audio/video streaming buffers, network packet buffers, command history (shell), and real-time data logging. Lock-free variants exist for concurrency.' },
        { question: 'What is a bitmask, and how can it be used with arrays?', difficulty: 'Hard', answer: 'A bitmask is an integer where each bit represents a boolean state. With arrays: track visited elements (2^n subsets), represent sets compactly, filter elements (arr[i] if mask & (1<<i)), implement DP over subsets. Example: traveling salesman uses dp[mask][i] where mask encodes visited cities.' }

      introduction: `Binary Search is a fundamental algorithm that reduces search time from O(n) to O(log n) by repeatedly dividing the search space in half. It's one of the most important patterns to master.

**The Key Insight:**
Binary search works on any **monotonic** property—not just sorted arrays. If you can define a predicate function that goes from False to True (or True to False) as you move through the search space, you can binary search.

**Why It's Powerful:**
- Reduces search from O(n) to O(log n)—for 1 billion elements, that's 30 operations vs 1 billion
- Works on answer spaces ("What's the minimum X such that condition holds?")
- Can find boundaries (leftmost/rightmost occurrence)`,

      introduction: `Two Pointers is a technique that uses two index variables to traverse a data structure, typically reducing time complexity from O(n²) to O(n). It's essential for array and linked list problems.

**Three Main Variants:**
1. **Opposite Direction**: Start from both ends, move toward center (e.g., Two Sum on sorted array)
2. **Same Direction**: Both pointers move in same direction at different speeds (e.g., slow/fast for cycle detection)
3. **Sliding Window**: Special case where pointers define a window (covered separately)

**The Key Insight:**
Two pointers work when you can eliminate possibilities by moving one pointer—either the current pair is optimal, or moving a pointer will definitely not make it worse.`,

      introduction: `Sliding Window is one of the most important patterns for string and subarray problems. It processes contiguous elements efficiently by maintaining a "window" that slides across the data.

**Two Types:**
1. **Fixed-Size Window**: Window size is constant (e.g., "max sum of k consecutive elements")
2. **Variable-Size Window**: Window expands and shrinks based on conditions (e.g., "shortest substring containing all characters")

**The Key Insight:**
Instead of recomputing the entire window from scratch at each step, we incrementally update by adding the new element and removing the old one. This reduces O(n*k) to O(n).

**Template for Variable Window:**
Expand the right pointer to include more elements. When a condition is violated, shrink from the left until valid again. Track the optimal window throughout.`,

      description: 'LIFO structure for parsing, backtracking, and monotonic stack patterns.',

      introduction: `Stacks follow Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. They're essential for problems involving nested structures, parsing, and finding relationships between elements.

**Key Applications:**
1. **Matching Brackets**: Validate nested structures (parentheses, HTML tags)
2. **Monotonic Stack**: Find next greater/smaller element in O(n)
3. **Expression Evaluation**: Parse and compute mathematical expressions
4. **Undo Operations**: Track state changes for backtracking

**The Monotonic Stack Pattern:**
A monotonic stack maintains elements in increasing or decreasing order. When a new element breaks the monotonicity, we pop elements and process them. This lets us find "next greater" or "next smaller" elements in O(n) total time.`,

        { question: 'What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a stack?', difficulty: 'Easy', answer: 'Advantages: simple O(1) operations, natural for recursion/backtracking, memory efficient, easy implementation.

        { question: 'How does a call stack work in programming, and why is it important?', difficulty: 'Easy', answer: 'Call stack tracks function invocations. On call: push stack frame (return address, parameters, locals). On return: pop frame, resume at return address. Manages execution context, enables recursion, provides automatic memory management for locals. Stack overflow occurs when depth exceeds limit.' },
        { question: 'Explain the concept of recursion and how it relates to the stack data structure.', difficulty: 'Easy', answer: 'Recursion: function calls itself with smaller subproblems until base case. Each call pushes frame onto call stack storing state. Stack naturally handles nested calls—LIFO matches unwinding order. Deep recursion risks stack overflow. Iterative + explicit stack often equivalent.' },

Stack\'s LIFO matches nested/hierarchical structures.' },
        { question: 'What happens when a stack overflows, and how can developers prevent it?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Stack overflow: exceeds allocated memory, causes crash/undefined behavior. Causes: deep/infinite recursion, large stack allocations.

      introduction: `Linked Lists test your ability to manipulate pointers and think about data structures. Unlike arrays, linked lists don't have random access but allow O(1) insertion/deletion at known positions.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Singly Linked**: Each node points to next (forward traversal only)
- **Doubly Linked**: Each node points to both next and previous
- **Dummy Head**: A fake head node that simplifies edge cases

**Critical Insight:**
Most linked list problems become easier if you:

        { question: 'What is a Linked List?', difficulty: 'Easy', answer: 'A linked list is a linear data structure where elements (nodes) contain data and pointer(s) to other nodes. Unlike arrays, elements aren\'t contiguous in memory. Enables O(1) insertion/deletion at known positions but O(n) access. Types: singly, doubly, circular. Used when frequent insertions/deletions needed.' },
        { question: 'What are the types of Linked Lists?', difficulty: 'Easy', answer: 'Singly linked: each node points to next, one-way traversal. Doubly linked: nodes point to both next and previous, bidirectional. Circular: last node points to first (singly or doubly). Variants: sorted, with sentinel/dummy nodes, skip lists. Choice depends on operations needed.' },
        { question: 'How do you insert an element at the beginning of a singly linked list?', difficulty: 'Easy', answer: 'Create new node, set new_node.next = head, update head = new_node. O(1) time. No traversal needed—just pointer manipulation. Handle empty list: same process, head was null. Common operation; doubly linked list also updates new_node.prev if needed.' },
        { question: 'How do you delete a node from a singly linked list?', difficulty: 'Easy', answer: 'Find predecessor of target node O(n), set prev.next = target.next, free/discard target. O(1) if predecessor known. Deleting head: update head = head.next. Challenge: can\'t find predecessor from target alone (need traversal or doubly linked). Handle single-node and empty cases.' },
        { question: 'What are some common use cases for linked lists?', difficulty: 'Easy', answer: 'Implementation of stacks/queues, LRU cache (with hash map), undo functionality, polynomial representation, memory allocation (free lists), adjacency lists for graphs, music playlists (next/previous), browser history. Best when: frequent insert/delete, unknown size, no random access needed.' },
        { question: 'What is the time complexity of inserting and deleting a node in a singly linked list?', difficulty: 'Easy', answer: 'Insert at head: O(1). Insert at tail: O(n) without tail pointer, O(1) with. Insert at position: O(n) to find position + O(1) to insert. Delete: O(n) to find predecessor + O(1) to remove. With doubly linked or given predecessor reference: O(1) for the operation itself.' },

        { question: 'Explain a Doubly Linked List and its advantages over a Singly Linked List.', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Doubly linked: each node has prev and next pointers. Advantages: O(1) delete with node reference (access predecessor directly), bidirectional traversal, easier reversal, simpler certain algorithms. Disadvantages: extra memory per node, more complex insert/delete code. Used in LRU cache, browser history.' },
        { question: 'What is a circular linked list, and where is it used?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Circular: last node points to first (no null terminator). Can be singly or doubly circular. Uses: round-robin scheduling, circular buffers, representing cycles (Josephus problem), media players (repeat playlist). Any node can be starting point. Detection: fast/slow pointers will meet.' },
        { question: 'How do you detect if a linked list has a cycle (loop)?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Floyd\'s algorithm: slow pointer moves 1 step, fast moves 2 steps. If cycle exists, they meet inside cycle. If fast reaches null, no cycle. O(n) time, O(1) space. Alternative: hash set of visited nodes O(n) space. To find cycle start: after meeting, reset one to head, both move 1 step until they meet again.' },
        { question: 'What is the difference between an array and a linked list?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Array: contiguous memory, O(1) random access, O(n) insert/delete (shifting), fixed size (or amortized resize), better cache locality. Linked list: scattered memory, O(n) access, O(1) insert/delete at known position, dynamic size, pointer overhead. Arrays for access-heavy; lists for modification-heavy.' },
        { question: 'When would you choose a linked list over an array or vice versa?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Linked list: frequent insertions/deletions at arbitrary positions, unknown final size, implementing deques/stacks efficiently, no random access needed. Array: random access required, memory efficiency matters, cache performance critical, size known/stable. Most cases: arrays preferred due to cache efficiency.' },
        { question: 'Explain the concept of a dummy or sentinel node in a linked list.', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Dummy/sentinel: placeholder node before actual head (or after tail). Simplifies code by eliminating null checks for empty list and head modification cases. Operations always have valid prev/next. Common in LRU cache, merge operations. After processing, return dummy.next as actual head.' },
        { question: 'What is a self-adjusting linked list, and why might it be useful?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Self-adjusting: reorganizes based on access patterns. Move-to-front: accessed element moved to head (O(1) for repeated access). Transpose: swap with predecessor. Approximates optimal static ordering over time. Useful for caches, frequently accessed data. Trade-off: extra movement overhead vs faster access for hot items.' },
        { question: 'Discuss the concept of a doubly linked list with a tail pointer.', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Tail pointer: maintain reference to last node in addition to head. Enables O(1) append (vs O(n) traversal). Combined with doubly linked: O(1) operations at both ends—perfect for deque implementation. Must update tail on deletions/insertions affecting it. LRU cache uses this pattern.' },
        { question: 'What is a circular doubly linked list?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Combines circular and doubly linked: last.next = first, first.prev = last. Full bidirectional navigation, no null pointers. Any node accesses entire list. Used in: OS process scheduling, navigation (wrap around), certain cache implementations. Insertion/deletion uniform anywhere. Detect full cycle when returning to start.' },
        { question: 'What is the runner or two-pointer technique in linked lists?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Two pointers traverse at different speeds or starting points. Fast/slow (cycle detection, find middle), ahead-by-k (kth from end), two-list (merge, intersection). Middle: slow at middle when fast reaches end. Kth from end: advance fast k steps, then both until fast.next null. O(n) time, O(1) space.' },

        { question: 'Explain the concept of a sparse linked list.', difficulty: 'Hard', answer: 'Sparse list stores only non-default values with their indices, linking consecutive entries.

        { question: 'Explain memory fragmentation in the context of linked lists.', difficulty: 'Hard', answer: 'Linked list nodes allocated separately scatter across memory (external fragmentation).

        { question: 'What is the difference between a singly linked list and a skip list?', difficulty: 'Hard', answer: 'Singly linked: O(n) search, single forward pointer.

        { question: 'What is the difference between an intrusive and non-intrusive linked list?', difficulty: 'Hard', answer: 'Non-intrusive: node contains pointer to data, data objects unaware of list. Intrusive: data structure contains list node (next/prev pointers embedded). Intrusive: no separate allocation, better cache locality, element can only be in one list of each type. Used in Linux kernel, game engines. Trade-off: flexibility vs performance.' },
        { question: 'Explain garbage collection in the context of linked lists.', difficulty: 'Hard', answer: 'GC reclaims unreachable nodes automatically. Mark-and-sweep: trace from roots (head), mark reachable, sweep unmarked. Linked structures challenging: scattered memory, pointer chasing.

      introduction: `Trees are hierarchical data structures essential for interviews. Most tree problems require recursive thinking—solving for the current node using solutions from subtrees.

**Key Tree Types:**
- **Binary Tree**: Each node has at most 2 children
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Left subtree < node < right subtree
- **Balanced Trees**: AVL, Red-Black (rarely implemented in interviews)
- **N-ary Trees**: Nodes can have any number of children

**Traversal Orders:**
- **Preorder**: Root → Left → Right (copying trees, prefix expressions)
- **Inorder**: Left → Root → Right (BST gives sorted order!)
- **Postorder**: Left → Right → Root (deleting trees, postfix expressions)
- **Level-order (BFS)**: Level by level using queue`,

      introduction: `Graphs model relationships between entities. Master graph traversal and you'll solve 15-20% of interview problems. Grids are graphs too—each cell connects to its neighbors.

**Graph Representations:**
- **Adjacency List**: {node: [neighbors]} - Best for sparse graphs, O(V+E) space
- **Adjacency Matrix**: grid[i][j] = 1 if edge - Best for dense graphs, O(V²) space
- **Edge List**: [(u, v, weight)] - Good for some algorithms like Kruskal's

**Key Algorithms:**
- **DFS**: Explore as deep as possible (recursion/stack)
- **BFS**: Explore level by level (queue) - shortest path in unweighted graphs
- **Topological Sort**: Order tasks with dependencies (DAG only)
- **Union-Find**: Track connected components efficiently
- **Dijkstra's**: Shortest path in weighted graphs`,

Storage: undirected needs both directions in adjacency list.' },

      introduction: `Dynamic Programming (DP) is one of the most important and challenging topics in coding interviews. It's used when a problem has overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.

**Two Approaches:**
1. **Top-Down (Memoization)**: Start with the main problem, recursively solve subproblems, cache results
2. **Bottom-Up (Tabulation)**: Start with base cases, build up to the solution iteratively

**Common DP Patterns:**
- **1D DP**: State depends on previous element(s) - dp[i]
- **2D DP**: State depends on two dimensions - dp[i][j]
- **Knapsack**: Include/exclude items with capacity constraint
- **LCS/LIS**: Subsequence problems
- **State Machine**: Multiple states to track (e.g., buy/sell stock)

**Key Insight:** If you can express a problem as "the optimal solution to problem of size n uses optimal solutions to smaller problems," it's likely DP.`,

      introduction: `A heap is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property: every parent is smaller (min-heap) or larger (max-heap) than its children. It provides O(log n) insert/delete and O(1) access to min/max.

**Key Operations:**
- **Push**: O(log n) - Add element and bubble up
- **Pop**: O(log n) - Remove root and heapify down
- **Peek**: O(1) - Access min/max without removing
- **Heapify**: O(n) - Convert array to heap

**Common Patterns:**
- **Top-K Largest**: Use min-heap of size K (counterintuitive!)
- **Top-K Smallest**: Use max-heap of size K
- **Merge K Sorted**: Use min-heap to track smallest from each list
- **Two Heaps**: Track median with max-heap (smaller half) + min-heap (larger half)`,

      introduction: `Backtracking is a systematic way to explore all possible solutions by building candidates incrementally and abandoning ("pruning") candidates that cannot lead to a valid solution.

**The Backtracking Template:**
1. **Choose**: Make a choice from available options
2. **Explore**: Recursively explore with that choice
3. **Unchoose**: Undo the choice (backtrack) and try next option

**Key Problem Types:**
- **Subsets**: All 2^n combinations (include or exclude each element)
- **Permutations**: All n! orderings (use each element exactly once)
- **Combinations**: All ways to choose k from n (order doesn't matter)
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Find solutions meeting constraints (N-Queens, Sudoku)

**Pruning is Critical:** Early termination of invalid paths dramatically improves performance from exponential worst case.`,

      description: 'Make locally optimal choices. Works when local optimum leads to global optimum.',

      introduction: `Greedy algorithms make the locally optimal choice at each step, hoping this leads to a globally optimal solution. Unlike Dynamic Programming which explores all possibilities, greedy commits to decisions without reconsidering them.

The key insight: if making the best choice right now doesn't hurt future choices, greedy works.

Greedy algorithms are powerful because they're typically:
• Simple to understand and implement
• Fast (often O(n) or O(n log n))
• Space efficient (often O(1))

However, greedy doesn't always work. Two properties must hold:
1. **Greedy Choice Property**: A locally optimal choice leads to a globally optimal solution
2. **Optimal Substructure**: The optimal solution contains optimal solutions to subproblems

Classic greedy success stories: Huffman coding, Dijkstra's shortest path, Kruskal's/Prim's MST, Activity Selection.

Classic greedy failures: 0/1 Knapsack (use DP), Traveling Salesman (NP-hard), Coin Change with arbitrary denominations.

In interviews, greedy problems often involve intervals, scheduling, or making sequential decisions where early choices don't affect later options.`,

      description: 'Prefix tree for string operations. Efficient autocomplete and spell check.',

      introduction: `A Trie (pronounced "try") or Prefix Tree is a specialized tree data structure used to store and retrieve strings efficiently. Unlike binary search trees where each node holds a single key, in a trie, each node represents a character, and paths from root to leaf spell out words.

Tries excel at prefix-based operations, making them essential for:
• Autocomplete systems (Google search suggestions)
• Spell checkers and dictionary lookups
• IP routing (longest prefix matching)
• Phone directories and contact search
• Word games (Scrabble, Boggle solvers)

The key insight is that common prefixes are shared - storing "car", "card", "care" uses far less space than storing them separately because "car" is shared. This structure enables O(m) search where m is the word length, regardless of how many words are stored.

Every trie interview problem fundamentally comes down to: tree traversal with character-by-character path building.`,

        { question: 'What is a Trie data structure, and why is it useful?', difficulty: 'Easy', answer: 'A Trie (prefix tree) stores strings character by character, sharing common prefixes. Each path from root represents a prefix. O(m) search/insert where m is word length (independent of dictionary size). Useful for: autocomplete, spell checking, IP routing, word games. Memory-efficient for datasets with shared prefixes.' },
        { question: 'Explain the basic structure of a Trie.', difficulty: 'Easy', answer: 'Root node (usually empty), child nodes for each character. Each node has: children map (char → node), is_end_of_word flag, optionally additional data (count, word itself). Edge labeled with character. Path from root to any node = a prefix. Leaf-to-root paths (with is_end) = stored words.' },
        { question: 'How does a Trie differ from a binary search tree (BST)?', difficulty: 'Easy', answer: 'BST: binary branching, compares entire keys, O(log n) operations, key stored at nodes. Trie: multi-way branching (alphabet size), character-by-character traversal, O(m) operations (key length), characters on edges. Trie for prefix operations; BST for general ordered data. Trie larger constant factor.' },
        { question: 'What are some common applications of Tries in real-world scenarios?', difficulty: 'Easy', answer: 'Autocomplete (type → suggestions), spell checkers (prefix search + edit distance), IP routing tables (longest prefix match), dictionary implementation, word games (Boggle, Scrabble), phone directories, DNA sequence search, predictive text, search engine suggestions. Anywhere prefix queries matter.' },
        // Mid
        { question: 'How do you handle memory optimization in a Trie?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Use hash map children instead of array[26] for sparse nodes. Compressed/Patricia tries merge single-child chains. Store only word endings, not intermediate nodes. Succinct tries use bit vectors. Double-array tries for read-heavy loads. Trade-off: memory vs speed. Array faster but wastes space for sparse alphabets.' },
        { question: 'What are the time and space complexities of common Trie operations?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Insert: O(m) time, O(m) new nodes worst case. Search: O(m) time. Prefix search: O(m + k) where k = results. Delete: O(m) time. Space: O(total characters across all words) worst case, better with shared prefixes. m = key length. Operations independent of n (total words).' },
        { question: 'Can you explain the concept of Trie depth and how it affects performance?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Depth = longest word length. Affects: maximum operations per search (O(depth)), memory per path, stack usage in recursion. Shallow tries = fast operations. Very long strings increase depth. Can limit depth and handle overflow specially. Depth typically bounded by application (word lengths, URLs, IPs).' },
        { question: 'What are some potential drawbacks or limitations of using Tries?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'High memory overhead (pointer per character), poor cache locality (scattered allocations), complex delete operation, large alphabet sizes increase branching. Not ideal for: few strings, no prefix queries needed, memory-constrained environments. Hash table often simpler and faster for exact match only.' },
        { question: 'What is the main advantage of using a Trie over a hash table for dictionary tasks?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Trie advantages: prefix queries (autocomplete, startsWith), ordered traversal (lexicographic), no hash collisions, worst-case O(m) not O(n). Hash table: O(1) average exact match, simpler. Choose trie when: prefix operations needed, alphabetically sorted iteration, or predictable worst-case required.' },
        { question: 'Explain the process of inserting a new word into a Trie.', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Start at root. For each character: if child exists, move to it; else create new node and move. After last character, mark current node as end_of_word = true. O(m) time where m = word length. Creates at most m new nodes. Existing prefixes share path.' },
        { question: 'What is the purpose of an end of word marker in Trie nodes?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Distinguishes complete words from prefixes. Example: "app" and "apple" share path to "app", but only the node after second "p" has marker for "app". Without marker, can\'t differentiate stored words from intermediate prefixes. Essential for search() vs startsWith() distinction.' },
        { question: 'How would you implement autocomplete functionality using a Trie?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Navigate to prefix\'s end node O(prefix_length). From there, DFS/BFS to collect all words (nodes with is_end = true). For top-K: store frequency counts, use priority queue. Optimization: store word at end nodes to avoid reconstruction. Return sorted by frequency or alphabetically.' },
        { question: 'What are some potential scenarios where a Trie might not be the best choice?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Few strings (hash table simpler), no prefix queries needed, very long keys (memory), large alphabets without compression, memory-constrained systems, random access patterns (poor locality). When exact match dominates and n is small, hash table or sorted array may be better.' },
        { question: 'Explain how you might handle case-insensitive searching in a Trie.', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Option 1: normalize on insert/search (lowercase all). Option 2: store both cases at each level (increases branching). Option 3: case-insensitive comparison function. Usually normalize to lowercase: char.lower() before accessing children. Consistent handling throughout insert and search operations.' },
        { question: 'Can you discuss how to efficiently remove a word from a Trie?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Navigate to word end, clear is_end flag. If node has no children and not end of another word, delete it and recursively delete ancestors until reaching a node with children or another is_end. Use recursive approach: delete returns whether to remove current node. O(m) time.' },
        { question: 'Discuss the concept of space-time trade-off in Trie data structures.', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'More space: array[alphabet_size] children per node → O(1) child access, more memory. Less space: hash map children → O(1) average but slower constant, less memory. Compressed tries: less space, more complex insert. Succinct tries: minimal space, complex operations. Choose based on query patterns and memory constraints.' },
        { question: 'How would you handle situations requiring efficient insertion and deletion?', difficulty: 'Medium', answer: 'Standard trie already provides O(m) insert/delete. For very dynamic scenarios: ensure proper node cleanup on delete (don\'t leak memory), use reference counting for shared nodes, consider lock-free tries for concurrent access. Monitor memory fragmentation with frequent insert/delete cycles.' },
        // Senior
        { question: 'How would you implement a Trie for variable-sized alphabets like Unicode?', difficulty: 'Hard', answer: 'Use hash map for children (handles sparse/large alphabets efficiently). Key = character (or codepoint), value = child node. Trade-off: array[65536] impractical, but hash map has overhead. Alternatively: multi-level tries (first level by category), compressed tries, or adaptive approaches based on actual character distribution.' },
        { question: 'What are some common optimization techniques to improve Trie performance?', difficulty: 'Hard', answer: 'Path compression (Patricia trie: merge single-child chains). Array children for small alphabets. Cache-efficient layout (store nodes contiguously). Lazy node creation. Pre-compute common queries. Succinct representation (rank/select on bit vectors). Level-order storage for BFS access patterns. Memoization for repeated prefix queries.' },
        { question: 'What is the difference between a Patricia Trie (Radix Tree) and a standard Trie?', difficulty: 'Hard', answer: 'Patricia/Radix trie compresses chains of single-child nodes into one edge labeled with string (not just character). Reduces nodes and depth for sparse tries. Example: storing "test" creates one edge "test" not four edges. More space-efficient, slightly more complex operations. Used in IP routing, databases.' },
        { question: 'Explain how you might perform wildcard pattern matching using a Trie.', difficulty: 'Hard', answer: 'For "." (any char): at that position, recursively try all children. For "*" (any sequence): complex—try matching 0, 1, 2... characters from current position. Use DFS with backtracking. Optimization: prune branches early when remaining pattern can\'t match. Example: Word Search II uses trie with grid DFS.' },
        { question: 'How would you store additional data (e.g., frequency counts) with each word?', difficulty: 'Hard', answer: 'Add field to node class: count, weight, metadata. Update on insert (increment count), or store at is_end nodes only. For autocomplete: store (frequency, word) pairs, sort by frequency. Can store word itself at end node to avoid reconstruction. Trade-off: more data per node increases memory.' }

      description: 'Operations on binary representations. XOR, AND, OR, shifts.',

      introduction: `Bit manipulation involves operating directly on the binary representation of numbers using bitwise operators. It's one of the most efficient techniques - operating at the hardware level with O(1) operations.

Master these operators:
• **AND (&)**: Both bits must be 1 → 1 & 1 = 1, otherwise 0
• **OR (|)**: At least one bit is 1 → 0 | 1 = 1
• **XOR (^)**: Different bits → 1 ^ 0 = 1, same bits → 1 ^ 1 = 0
• **NOT (~)**: Flip all bits → ~0 = 1111...1
• **Left shift (<<)**: Multiply by 2^n → 1 << 3 = 8
• **Right shift (>>)**: Divide by 2^n → 8 >> 2 = 2

The magic of XOR:
• a ^ a = 0 (any number XOR itself is 0)
• a ^ 0 = a (any number XOR 0 is itself)
• XOR is commutative and associative

This makes XOR perfect for finding unique elements - pairs cancel out!

Bit manipulation appears in: finding duplicates/missing numbers, efficient math (multiply/divide by powers of 2), state compression in DP, and low-level system programming.`,

        { question: 'What is bit manipulation, and why is it important in software development?', difficulty: 'Easy', answer: 'Bit manipulation operates directly on binary representations using bitwise operators. Important for: O(1) operations on sets (bitmasks), memory efficiency, cryptography, compression, graphics, hardware interfacing. Single CPU instructions—extremely fast. Common patterns: check/set/clear/toggle bits, find single number (XOR), count bits.' },
        { question: 'Explain how the bitwise AND operator (&) works and provide an example.', difficulty: 'Easy', answer: 'AND: returns 1 only if both bits are 1. Example: 5 & 3 = 101 & 011 = 001 = 1. Uses: check if bit set (n & (1<<i)), clear bits (n & mask), extract bits, check even/odd (n & 1). Masking pattern: keep bits where mask is 1. Common: n & (n-1) removes lowest set bit.' },
        { question: 'Explain how the bitwise OR operator (|) works and provide an example.', difficulty: 'Easy', answer: 'OR: returns 1 if either bit is 1. Example: 5 | 3 = 101 | 011 = 111 = 7. Uses: set specific bits (n | (1<<i)), combine flags, union of bit sets. Grows the number (never removes 1s). Common: building bitmask from multiple flags, initializing with defaults.' },
        { question: 'Explain how the bitwise NOT operator (~) works and provide an example.', difficulty: 'Easy', answer: 'NOT: flips all bits (0→1, 1→0). Example: ~5 = ~00000101 = 11111010 = -6 (two\'s complement). Uses: create inverse mask, toggle all bits. Note: ~n = -(n+1) in two\'s complement. Often combined with AND to clear bits: n & ~(1<<i) clears bit i.' },
        { question: 'Explain how the bitwise XOR operator (^) works and provide an example.', difficulty: 'Easy', answer: 'XOR: returns 1 if bits differ. Example: 5 ^ 3 = 101 ^ 011 = 110 = 6. Properties: a^a=0, a^0=a, commutative, associative. Uses: find single number among pairs, swap without temp (a^=b; b^=a; a^=b), toggle bits, simple encryption. Powerful for "appears once" problems.' },
        { question: 'What does the bitwise left shift operator (<<) do, and provide an example.', difficulty: 'Easy', answer: 'Left shift: moves bits left, fills right with zeros. Example: 5 << 2 = 101 << 2 = 10100 = 20. Equivalent to multiply by 2^n. Uses: create mask (1<<i), multiply power of 2 (faster than *), building bit patterns. Overflow: bits shifted out are lost.' },

      introduction: `Math and geometry problems test your understanding of fundamental algorithms and mathematical reasoning. These problems often have elegant O(1) or O(log n) solutions once you know the right formula or technique.

Key mathematical concepts:
• **GCD/LCM**: Foundation for fraction simplification, coprime checks
• **Prime Numbers**: Sieve of Eratosthenes, primality testing
• **Modular Arithmetic**: Essential for avoiding overflow in large calculations
• **Fast Exponentiation**: O(log n) power calculation via binary method

Geometry concepts:
• **Cross Product**: Determine orientation (clockwise/counterclockwise)
• **Dot Product**: Project vectors, find angles
• **Line Intersection**: Parametric equations, determinant method
• **Convex Hull**: Graham scan, Jarvis march

Common interview patterns:
• Digit manipulation (reverse integer, palindrome number)
• Random sampling (reservoir sampling, shuffle)
• Coordinate geometry (rectangle overlap, valid square)
• Matrix transformations (rotate, spiral)

The key insight for math problems: look for patterns, use modular arithmetic to avoid overflow, and remember that brute force is often O(n) but smart math gives O(log n) or O(1).`,

      introduction: `Matrix problems involve 2D arrays and test your ability to navigate, transform, and search within grid structures. These problems are common because they combine array manipulation with spatial reasoning.

Key traversal patterns:
• **Row-major**: Process row by row (standard iteration)
• **Column-major**: Process column by column
• **Diagonal**: Process along diagonals
• **Spiral**: Outside-in or inside-out circular pattern
• **Layer by layer**: Process outer ring, then inner rings

Common operations:
• **Rotation**: 90°, 180°, 270° rotations
• **Transpose**: Swap rows and columns
• **Search**: Binary search on sorted matrix
• **Path finding**: DFS/BFS for connected components

Matrix in disguise problems:
• Game boards (Sudoku, Tic-Tac-Toe, Game of Life)
• Image processing (flood fill, filters)
• Grid DP (unique paths, minimum path sum)

The key insight: matrices are just indexed by (row, col) pairs. Master the index transformations for rotation, and use boundary pointers for spiral traversal.`,

      introduction: `Recursion is a problem-solving technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It's the foundation for understanding trees, graphs, divide and conquer, and dynamic programming.

Every recursive solution has two essential parts:
• **Base Case(s)**: The simplest case(s) that can be solved directly without recursion
• **Recursive Case**: Breaking the problem into smaller subproblems and calling the function on them

The magic of recursion: you trust that the recursive call works correctly, then just handle how to combine results.

How to think recursively:
1. What is the smallest/simplest input? (Base case)
2. How can I reduce this problem to a smaller version of itself?
3. How do I combine results from subproblems?

Recursion vs Iteration:
• Every recursive solution can be converted to iterative (and vice versa)
• Recursion uses call stack space (can cause stack overflow)
• Recursion is more natural for tree/graph traversal
• Tail recursion can be optimized by some compilers to use O(1) space

Understanding recursion deeply unlocks: binary tree problems, divide and conquer, backtracking, and dynamic programming.`,

      introduction: `Sorting is a fundamental operation that arranges elements in a specific order. Understanding sorting algorithms is crucial because:
1. Many problems become easier after sorting (binary search, two pointers)
2. Sorting is often a key step in algorithms (greedy, intervals)
3. Custom comparators enable complex sorting logic

Comparison-based sorting (O(n log n) lower bound):
• **Merge Sort**: Stable, guaranteed O(n log n), but O(n) space
• **Quick Sort**: In-place, average O(n log n), worst O(n²)
• **Heap Sort**: In-place, guaranteed O(n log n), not stable

Non-comparison sorting (can beat O(n log n)):
• **Counting Sort**: O(n + k) for integers in range [0, k]
• **Radix Sort**: O(d × (n + k)) for d-digit numbers
• **Bucket Sort**: O(n) average for uniformly distributed data

Stability: A sort is stable if equal elements maintain their relative order. Important when sorting by multiple keys.

In interviews, you'll rarely implement sort from scratch. Instead, focus on:
• Choosing the right algorithm for the situation
• Writing custom comparators
• Understanding when pre-sorting helps the overall algorithm`,

      description: 'Problems involving ranges and overlapping segments.',

      introduction: `Interval problems involve operations on ranges or segments, often requiring merging, insertion, or conflict detection. These problems appear frequently in scheduling, calendar, and resource allocation contexts.

Key concepts:
• **Overlap detection**: Two intervals [a, b] and [c, d] overlap if a < d AND c < b
• **Sorting strategy**: Sort by start time (merging) or end time (scheduling)
• **Sweep line**: Process events (start/end) in sorted order

Common patterns:
1. **Merge Intervals**: Combine overlapping intervals
2. **Insert Interval**: Add new interval and merge if needed
3. **Meeting Rooms**: Can all meetings fit? How many rooms needed?
4. **Interval Scheduling**: Maximize non-overlapping intervals (greedy)
5. **Minimum Removals**: Remove fewest intervals to eliminate overlaps

The key insight: sorting transforms interval problems into linear scans. Sort by start time for merging, end time for scheduling/greedy selection.

Sweep line technique: Instead of treating intervals as wholes, process START and END events separately in sorted order. This handles complex queries like "maximum overlapping at any point."`,

      introduction: `Search algorithms are fundamental techniques for finding elements or optimal values. Binary search is the most important - it reduces O(n) to O(log n) and appears in countless interview problems.

Binary Search Basics:
• Requires sorted data (or monotonic property)
• Repeatedly halve the search space
• O(log n) time, O(1) space

Beyond basic search, binary search applies to:
• **Search on answer space**: Find minimum/maximum valid answer
• **Search for boundary**: First/last occurrence, insertion point
• **Peak finding**: Find local maximum/minimum in unsorted data
• **Rotated arrays**: Modified binary search

The key insight: Binary search works whenever you can make a binary decision that eliminates half the search space. This extends far beyond sorted arrays!

Common variations:
• Find exact match vs insertion point
• Find first vs last occurrence
• Search in rotated sorted array
• Binary search on real numbers (floating point)
• Binary search on answer (minimum days, maximum capacity)`,
