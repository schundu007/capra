    description: 'Design a real-time team messaging platform with channels, threads, file sharing, and presence indicators.',

    introduction: `Slack-style team collaboration platforms present a fascinating mix of real-time messaging, persistent history, and rich integrations. Unlike 1-to-1 messaging apps, Slack revolves around channels (many-to-many communication) with threading, reactions, file attachments, and powerful search across an organization's entire message corpus.

The core technical challenges include: maintaining WebSocket connections for millions of concurrent users, fan-out of messages to potentially thousands of channel members simultaneously, providing sub-second search across billions of messages, and handling the "presence" system that shows who is online in real-time.

A well-designed Slack system must balance write-heavy workloads (messages, reactions, edits) with read-heavy patterns (scrolling history, searching), while keeping the real-time experience feeling instantaneous.`,

      {
        question: 'How do you deliver messages in real-time to all channel members?',
        answer: `**Fan-out via WebSocket Gateways + Pub/Sub**:
1. User sends message -> hits any API server via load balancer
2. API server persists to Kafka (durable) and Cassandra
3. API server publishes to a Redis Pub/Sub channel: \`channel:{channelId}\`
4. Each WebSocket Gateway subscribes to channels its connected users belong to
5. Gateway pushes message to relevant WebSocket connections

**Optimization for Large Channels (10K+ members)**:
- Don't fan-out to offline users; they load history on reconnect
- Use "lazy delivery": only push to users who have the channel in view
- Background workers compute push notifications for mobile users separately

**Connection State Management**:
- Gateway registers \`userId -> gatewayId\` in Redis on connect
- On disconnect, entry is removed; presence service updated
- If a gateway crashes, its entries expire via Redis TTL (30s)`
      },
      {
        question: 'How does search work across billions of messages?',
        answer: `**Elasticsearch-Based Search Pipeline**:
1. Messages flow through Kafka -> Search Indexer -> Elasticsearch
2. Index is partitioned by workspace_id for tenant isolation
3. Each message document includes: content (analyzed), channel_id, sender, timestamp

**Query Processing**:
- \`from:alice in:#engineering after:2024-01-01 deployment\`
- Parsed into structured Elasticsearch query with filters + full-text match
- Results ranked by relevance (BM25) with recency boost

**Scaling Strategies**:
- Shard Elasticsearch index by workspace_id (large workspaces get dedicated shards)
- Older messages (>1 year) moved to cold storage indices with fewer replicas
- Query routing: recent-first search hits hot shards, falls back to cold if needed
- Index lag is acceptable (1-5 seconds) since search is not the primary read path`
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you handle user presence at scale?',
        answer: `**Heartbeat + Redis EXPIRE Approach**:
- Client sends heartbeat every 30 seconds via WebSocket
- Server sets Redis key: \`presence:{userId} = {status, lastSeen}\` with 60s TTL
- If no heartbeat in 60s, key expires -> user is offline

**Presence Fan-out (the hard part)**:
- When user status changes, who needs to know?
- Naive: broadcast to all workspace members (too expensive for 100K org)
- Optimized: only notify users who have the status-changed user visible
  - Track "presence subscriptions" per client (users in sidebar, open DMs)
  - On status change, look up subscribers and push only to them

**Consistency Trade-off**:
- Presence is inherently approximate (network delays, heartbeat intervals)
- Eventual consistency is fine: 30-60 second staleness is acceptable
- Mobile users: even longer intervals (2-5 minutes) to save battery`

    introduction: `TikTok-style platforms are among the most challenging system design problems because they combine massive video storage and delivery with a sophisticated recommendation engine that drives user engagement. Unlike traditional social media where you follow accounts, TikTok's "For You Page" is powered primarily by an interest graph rather than a social graph.

The system must handle enormous data volumes: millions of video uploads per day, each requiring transcoding into multiple resolutions and formats, storage in a global CDN, and delivery to billions of personalized feeds. The recommendation engine must process implicit signals (watch time, replays, skips) in real-time to keep the feed fresh and engaging.

Key architectural tensions include: upload processing latency vs. quality, recommendation freshness vs. computation cost, and global content delivery vs. regional content moderation requirements.`,

        question: 'How does the recommendation algorithm work?',
        answer: `**Two-Phase Recommendation Pipeline**:

**Phase 1: Candidate Generation (~1000 videos from millions)**
- Multiple candidate sources run in parallel:
  - Collaborative filtering: users who watched X also watched Y
  - Content-based: videos similar to ones you engaged with (embedding similarity)
  - Social: videos liked by people you follow
  - Trending: globally/regionally popular recent videos
- Each source returns ~200-500 candidates, merged and deduplicated

**Phase 2: Ranking (~30 videos from 1000)**
- Neural ranking model scores each candidate
- Features: user embedding, video embedding, context (time of day, device), cross-features
- Prediction target: P(watch >75%) * engagement_score
- Final re-ranking applies diversity rules (no >3 consecutive same-creator, topic mixing)

**Real-time Signal Loop**:
- User watches/skips -> event to Kafka -> Flink updates session context
- Next feed request uses updated context -> recommendations adapt within seconds
- This "tight loop" is what makes TikTok's feed feel uncannily personalized`
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you handle video upload and transcoding?',
        answer: `**Chunked Upload Pipeline**:
1. Client splits video into 2MB chunks, uploads to pre-signed S3 URLs
2. Upload service tracks chunks, assembles on completion
3. Publishes \`VideoUploaded\` event to Kafka

**Transcoding Pipeline**:
1. Transcoding worker pulls from Kafka, downloads raw video from S3
2. FFmpeg produces multiple renditions: 360p, 720p, 1080p, plus adaptive bitrate (HLS/DASH)
3. Generates thumbnail, extracts audio waveform, computes content hash (dedup)
4. Uploads all artifacts to S3, publishes \`VideoTranscoded\` event

**Content Moderation (parallel)**:
1. Visual AI scans frames for policy violations
2. Audio analysis checks for copyrighted music
3. OCR + NLP on text overlays
4. If flagged, video enters human review queue; otherwise auto-approved

**Reliability**:
- Each step is idempotent with at-least-once delivery
- Dead letter queue for persistently failing transcodes
- Typical pipeline: 30-60 seconds for short videos (< 1 min)`
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you handle the CDN and global video delivery?',
        answer: `**Multi-Tier CDN Strategy**:

**Tier 1 - Edge PoPs (200+ locations)**:
- Cache the top ~10K videos globally (covers 60-70% of traffic)
- Each PoP has SSD storage for cached segments
- Cache key: \`{videoId}:{resolution}:{segment}\`

**Tier 2 - Regional Origin Shields (10-15 regions)**:
- Cache long-tail content missed at edge
- Reduces load on central origin by 90%+
- Regional content moderation filtering applied here

**Tier 3 - Central Origin (2-3 data centers)**:
- S3/GCS stores all transcoded video permanently
- Only serves cache misses from Tier 2 (~1-2% of traffic)

**Adaptive Bitrate Streaming**:
- HLS segments (2-4 seconds each) at multiple quality levels
- Client-side ABR algorithm switches quality based on bandwidth
- Pre-buffer next video while current plays (feels instant)

**Optimization**:
- Predictive pre-caching: push newly viral videos to edge before they spike
- Geo-aware routing: DNS-based or anycast to nearest healthy PoP
- Cost optimization: serve from cheapest healthy PoP (cloud egress costs vary)`

Unlike traditional feeds sorted chronologically, Reddit uses time-decay ranking algorithms (Hot, Best, Controversial, Top) that combine vote scores with post age. This requires continuous re-ranking as votes arrive, which is computationally expensive at scale.

The nested comment system is another distinguishing challenge: a popular post can have tens of thousands of comments organized in deep tree structures, and efficiently loading, sorting, and rendering these trees is non-trivial.`,

    keyQuestions: [
      {
        question: 'How does the Hot ranking algorithm work?',
        answer: `**Reddit's Hot Algorithm (simplified)**:
\`\`\`
hot_score = log10(max(|score|, 1)) + sign(score) * (created_epoch / 45000)
\`\`\`
- The log of the score means early votes matter more (going from 1->10 = same boost as 10->100)
- The time component increases linearly: newer posts get a constant score boost
- Net effect: a post with 10 upvotes now beats a post with 100 upvotes from yesterday

**Pre-computation Strategy**:
- Background worker recalculates hot_score every 30-60 seconds for active subreddits
- Writes updated scores to Redis sorted set: \`ZADD feed:subreddit:hot score postId\`
- Feed reads become simple ZREVRANGE: O(log N + K) for top K posts
- Only recalculates for posts from the last 48 hours (older posts have effectively static rank)

**The "Best" Sort for Comments** uses Wilson score interval:
- Accounts for sample size: 5/5 upvotes ranks lower than 100/110 upvotes
- More statistically sound than simple upvote percentage`
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you efficiently load nested comment trees?',
        answer: `**Materialized Path with ltree**:
- Each comment stores its full path: "post_123.c1.c5.c12"
- Top-level: fetch WHERE post_id = X AND parent_id IS NULL ORDER BY score LIMIT 200
- Expand branch: fetch WHERE path <@ 'post_123.c1' AND depth <= parent_depth + 3

**Loading Strategy (progressive)**:
1. First load: top 200 root comments, sorted by "best", with top 3 replies each
2. "Load more replies": fetch next depth level for a specific branch
3. "Continue thread": new page load for deeply nested chains (depth > 10)

**"More comments" stubs**:
- When a branch has >3 replies at a level, return a stub: { type: "more", count: 47, ids: [...] }
- Client fetches \`GET /api/morecomments?ids=c1,c2,...\` on click
- Server returns only the requested subtree

**Performance Numbers**:
- Top-level fetch: ~5ms (indexed query + Redis cache)
- Branch expansion: ~10ms (ltree index makes subtree queries fast)
- Full 50K comment tree: never loaded at once; progressive loading keeps latency <100ms per interaction`
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you handle vote counting at scale?',
        answer: `**Multi-Layer Vote Processing**:

**Layer 1 - Redis (immediate)**:
- Vote hits Redis: INCR post:{id}:up or INCR post:{id}:down
- Also SET user_vote:{userId}:{postId} = direction (for UI state)
- Response returns immediately with optimistic score

**Layer 2 - Kafka (durable)**:
- Vote event published to Kafka topic for durable processing
- Event: { userId, targetId, direction, timestamp }

**Layer 3 - DB Flush (periodic)**:
- Consumer batches votes per post (every 5-10 seconds)
- Single UPDATE posts SET upvotes = upvotes + batch_up, downvotes = downvotes + batch_down
- Reduces write contention from 1000s of individual updates to one batch update

**Idempotency**:
- Redis SET for user_vote prevents duplicate counting
- Changing vote: decrement old direction, increment new
- Kafka consumer uses userId+targetId as dedup key

**Consistency Trade-off**:
- Score displayed may be 5-10 seconds stale (acceptable)
- Vote direction (did I upvote?) is always consistent (served from Redis)
- Final DB score is eventually consistent after flush`

    description: 'Design a live video streaming platform with real-time chat, low-latency broadcasting, and millions of concurrent viewers.',

    introduction: `Live streaming platforms like Twitch represent one of the most demanding distributed systems challenges, combining real-time video ingestion and distribution with massive concurrent chat systems. Unlike on-demand video (Netflix, YouTube), live streaming has strict latency requirements: viewers expect to see events within 2-5 seconds of real-time.

The two main subsystems are the video pipeline (ingest -> transcode -> distribute via CDN) and the chat system (which must broadcast messages to chatrooms with 100K+ concurrent participants). Each has distinct scaling characteristics and failure modes.

The economic model also influences architecture: streamers produce content (write-heavy ingest), but viewership is heavily skewed -- a small number of popular streams serve millions while most streams have fewer than 10 viewers. This skew affects caching, CDN strategy, and resource allocation decisions.`,

      {
        question: 'How does the live video pipeline work end-to-end?',
        answer: `**Glass-to-Glass Pipeline (target: <5 seconds)**:

**1. Ingest (Streamer -> Platform, ~500ms)**
- Streamer's OBS sends RTMP to nearest ingest PoP (DNS-based routing)
- Ingest server receives raw H.264/AAC stream

**2. Transcode (~1-2 seconds)**
- GPU-accelerated transcoding at the ingest PoP
- Produces 4 quality levels: source, 720p, 480p, 160p
- Segments stream into 2-second HLS chunks (.ts files)

**3. Distribution (~1-2 seconds)**
- Segments pushed to origin storage + CDN edge nodes
- Popular streams: proactive push to all edges
- Long-tail streams: pull-through caching on first viewer request

**4. Playback (~500ms)**
- Client fetches master playlist (lists available qualities)
- ABR algorithm picks quality based on measured bandwidth
- Client buffers 2-4 seconds of segments for smooth playback

**Failure Handling**:
- Ingest PoP failure: streamer reconnects to next-nearest PoP (auto-reconnect in OBS)
- Transcode failure: fallback to single-quality passthrough
- CDN failure: failover to secondary CDN provider`
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you scale chat to 100K+ concurrent users in one room?',
        answer: `**Tiered Chat Architecture**:

**Tier 1 - WebSocket Gateway (connection handling)**:
- Each server holds ~50K WebSocket connections
- Popular chat room spans 5-20 gateway servers
- Gateway servers register with a Chat Coordinator: "I have 5000 users for channel X"

**Tier 2 - Chat Service (message processing)**:
- Receives messages from any gateway, validates, applies moderation
- Publishes to Redis Pub/Sub channel: \`chat:{channelId}\`
- All gateways for that channel subscribe and broadcast to their connections

**Scaling Beyond 50K Messages/sec**:
- Problem: even Redis Pub/Sub has limits (~500K msg/sec per channel)
- Solution: message batching -- accumulate messages for 100ms, send as batch
- Further: server-side sampling for extreme rooms (>100K users):
  - Show all moderator/subscriber messages
  - Sample regular messages at 1/N rate to stay under bandwidth budget
  - Each client sees a different random sample (feels full-speed)

**Moderation Pipeline** (inline, <50ms):
- Blocked words filter (Aho-Corasick automaton)
- Slow mode: rate limit per user per channel
- Follower-only / subscriber-only mode
- AutoMod ML classifier for toxicity (async, flag for review)`
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you handle the viewer count skew?',
        answer: `**The Long-Tail Problem**:
- Top 100 streams: 80% of all viewers
- Bottom 90% of streams: <10 viewers each

**Resource Allocation Strategy**:

**For Popular Streams (>1000 viewers)**:
- Dedicated transcoding GPU slots
- Proactive CDN edge caching (push model)
- Chat room gets dedicated Redis Pub/Sub channels
- Multiple gateway servers assigned

**For Long-Tail Streams (<100 viewers)**:
- Shared transcoding pool (may only produce 2 quality levels)
- CDN pull-through caching (first viewer triggers cache fill)
- Chat handled by shared multi-room gateway servers
- Single Redis channel suffices

**Dynamic Scaling**:
- Monitor viewer count changes in real-time
- "Raid" events (streamer sends all viewers to another): triggers pre-warming
  - Alert CDN: warm cache for target stream at edges where raid viewers are
  - Spin up additional chat gateways for target channel
  - Scale up transcoding quality for target stream
- Scaling down: cool-off period of 5 minutes before reducing resources`

        answer: `**Multi-Stage Spam Pipeline (inline, <2 seconds)**:

**Stage 1 - Connection-Level (SMTP)**:
- IP reputation check against known spam sources
- SPF record validation (is sender authorized for this domain?)
- DKIM signature verification (was the email tampered with?)
- DMARC policy check (what does the domain owner want us to do?)

**Stage 2 - Content Analysis**:
- Heuristic rules engine (SpamAssassin-like): checks headers, body patterns
- ML classifier trained on billions of user-reported spam/not-spam decisions
- URL reputation: check links against known phishing databases
- Attachment sandboxing: execute suspicious attachments in a VM, observe behavior

**Stage 3 - Aggregate Signals**:
- If 1000 users received the same email body hash in the last hour -> likely spam
- Sender reputation score: based on historical spam reports from all recipients
- New sender penalty: first email from unknown sender gets extra scrutiny

**Scoring**: Each stage contributes to a composite spam_score (0.0 to 1.0).
- < 0.3: deliver to Inbox
- 0.3-0.7: deliver to Spam folder
- > 0.7: reject at SMTP level (saves storage)

**Feedback Loop**: Users marking "Not Spam" or "Report Spam" feeds back into ML training.`

        question: 'How do you handle email search across years of history?',
        answer: `**Per-User Elasticsearch Sharding**:

**Index Strategy**:
- Each user's emails are indexed in a dedicated Elasticsearch shard group
- Routing key = user_id ensures all of a user's documents land on the same shard
- Typical user has 50K-500K emails -> single shard handles this easily

**What's Indexed**:
- From, To, Cc, Subject: keyword fields (exact match + prefix)
- Body text: analyzed with standard tokenizer + language detection
- Labels, has_attachment, size_range: keyword filters
- Date: date range queries

**Query Examples**:
- \`from:alice@company.com has:attachment after:2024/01/01 quarterly report\`
- Parsed into: bool query with term filters (from, has_attachment, date range) + match query (body text)

**Performance**:
- Query scoped to single user's shard -> very fast (<100ms for most queries)
- Heavy users (1M+ emails): may need 2-3 shards, but Elasticsearch handles this transparently

**Indexing Pipeline**:
- New email -> Kafka -> Search Indexer -> Elasticsearch
- Index lag: 1-5 seconds (search may not find email sent 1 second ago)
- Deleted/archived emails: soft delete in index, periodic cleanup`
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you ensure zero email loss?',
        answer: `**Durability at Every Stage**:

**SMTP Reception**:
- Email is only ACK'd to sending server after it's durably written to Kafka
- If server crashes before ACK, sending server retries (SMTP guarantees this)
- Kafka topic has replication factor 3, min.insync.replicas = 2

**Processing Pipeline**:
- Each consumer checkpoints progress in Kafka (consumer offsets)
- If consumer crashes mid-processing, it replays from last checkpoint
- Idempotent writes to Bigtable (same email processed twice = same result)

**Storage**:
- Bigtable: data replicated across 3+ data centers (synchronous replication)
- Blob storage (GCS): 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability
- Cross-region replication: emails are readable from any region within minutes

**Defense in Depth**:
- WAL (write-ahead log) at every persistent component
- Daily consistency checks: compare Kafka offsets vs Bigtable row counts
- Backup Kafka cluster in different region for disaster recovery
- Deletion has 30-day soft-delete window (Trash -> permanent delete after 30 days)`

    introduction: `Cloud file storage systems like Google Drive combine several difficult distributed systems challenges: reliable file sync across devices, real-time collaborative editing, fine-grained permission models, and efficient storage of petabytes of user files including deduplication and versioning.

Unlike simple blob storage (S3), a Drive-like system must maintain a hierarchical file/folder namespace per user, support shared folders that appear in multiple users' views, track detailed version history, and synchronize changes across desktop clients, mobile apps, and web interfaces in near real-time.

The sync engine is particularly challenging: it must handle concurrent modifications from multiple devices, resolve conflicts gracefully, work offline with eventual sync, and minimize bandwidth by transferring only deltas rather than full files.`,

    keyQuestions: [
      {
        question: 'How does file sync work across devices?',
        answer: `**Change-Based Sync Protocol**:

**Server Side**:
- Every file mutation generates a change_log entry with a monotonically increasing change_id
- Change log is per-user (each user's "view" of the filesystem)
- Shared file edits generate entries in all viewers' change logs

**Client Side**:
- Client stores \`last_synced_change_id\` locally
- On sync: \`GET /api/changes?startChangeId=12345\`
- Server returns all changes since that ID
- Client applies changes to local state, updates checkpoint

**Real-Time Notification**:
- Client maintains long-poll connection to sync service
- When a change occurs, sync service notifies affected clients immediately
- Client fetches the actual changes via the changes API

**Conflict Resolution**:
- Same file edited on two offline devices -> conflict
- Strategy: keep both versions, rename conflicting copy: "report (conflict from Device B).docx"
- For Google Docs (collaborative): OT/CRDT handles concurrent edits in real-time, no conflicts possible

**Bandwidth Optimization**:
- Only sync metadata for unmodified files (name, permissions)
- For modified files, use rolling checksum to identify changed blocks
- Only upload/download changed 4MB blocks`
      },
      {
        question: 'How does content-addressable storage and deduplication work?',
        answer: `**Content-Addressable Storage (CAS)**:
- File is split into 4MB chunks
- Each chunk hashed with SHA-256: \`chunk_hash = SHA256(chunk_bytes)\`
- Chunk stored at path derived from hash: \`/ab/cd/abcdef1234...\`
- File metadata stores ordered list of chunk hashes

**Deduplication Levels**:

**Cross-user dedup**: If Alice and Bob both upload the same 1GB video, only one copy stored
- On upload: compute chunk hashes, check if hash exists in blob store
- If exists: increment ref_count, skip upload (instant "upload")
- Savings: ~30% for consumer storage, ~60% for enterprise (shared documents)

**Cross-version dedup**: Editing page 50 of a 200-page PDF
- Only the chunk containing page 50 changes
- New version references 49 unchanged chunks + 1 new chunk
- Version storage cost: ~1 chunk instead of entire file

**Garbage Collection**:
- Blob ref_count tracks how many file versions reference each chunk
- When ref_count reaches 0: chunk eligible for deletion
- GC runs offline, marks and sweeps unreferenced chunks weekly
- 30-day grace period before physical deletion (safety buffer)`
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you handle permissions for shared folders?',
        answer: `**Hierarchical Permission Model**:

**Permission Types**: Owner > Editor > Commenter > Viewer
**Inheritance Rule**: Child inherits parent's permissions unless explicitly overridden

**Storage**:
- Explicit permissions stored in \`permissions\` table
- Inherited permissions computed at read time (or cached)

**Permission Check Algorithm**:
1. Check explicit permissions on the file
2. If none found, walk up the folder tree checking each parent
3. First explicit permission found = effective permission
4. Root folder with no permission = no access

**Caching Strategy** (permissions are read-heavy):
- Build a materialized permission map per file: \`{userId -> role}\`
- Cache in Redis with TTL = 5 minutes
- On permission change: publish invalidation event to Pub/Sub
- All nodes receiving event clear cached permissions for affected subtree

**Shared Folder Challenges**:
- Shared folder appears in multiple users' "My Drive" (as a virtual link)
- Moving a shared folder: only the owner can move it
- Removing yourself from shared folder: removes the link, not the folder
- "Anyone with link" permissions: verified at download time using signed URL + permission check`

    introduction: `Shopify-style platforms are multi-tenant e-commerce systems where millions of merchants each run their own online store on shared infrastructure. This is fundamentally different from designing a single e-commerce site (like Amazon): the challenge is providing isolated, customizable storefronts while sharing underlying infrastructure efficiently.

Key architectural challenges include: multi-tenancy (data isolation between merchants while sharing resources), handling traffic spikes that vary independently per merchant (one merchant's flash sale shouldn't affect others), payment processing with PCI compliance, and supporting a plugin/app ecosystem that extends merchant functionality.

The system must balance customizability (each store looks and behaves differently) with operational efficiency (millions of stores on shared infrastructure). This tension drives many architectural decisions around tenant isolation, resource allocation, and deployment models.`,

        answer: `**Pod-Based Multi-Tenancy**:

**What is a Pod?**
- Self-contained infrastructure unit: app servers + DB shard + Redis + queues
- Each pod serves ~10K stores
- Pods are independently scalable and deployable

**Data Isolation**:
- Every table includes \`store_id\` as partition key
- Database connection middleware injects store_id filter on every query
- Cross-store queries are impossible by design (no JOINs across shards)

**Resource Isolation**:
- Rate limiting per store: API calls/sec, webhook deliveries/sec
- CPU and memory limits per request: prevent one store's heavy query from starving others
- Separate checkout infrastructure: not affected by catalog browsing spikes

**Large Store Handling (Shopify Plus)**:
- Stores exceeding 100K orders/day get a dedicated pod
- Custom scaling rules: auto-scale pod based on that store's traffic patterns
- Dedicated CDN cache allocation for storefront assets

**Routing Layer**:
1. Request arrives at edge CDN with Host header (store domain)
2. Edge looks up store_id from domain mapping (cached, <1ms)
3. Routes to correct pod's load balancer
4. Application layer validates store context for every request`

      {
        question: 'How does checkout handle inventory under high concurrency?',
        answer: `**Distributed Inventory Reservation Protocol**:

**Problem**: 100 people click "Buy" for the last item simultaneously. Only one should succeed.

**Two-Phase Approach**:

**Phase 1 - Reservation (at "Add to Cart" / "Begin Checkout")**:
- \`DECR inventory_reserved:{variantId}:{locationId}\` in Redis
- If result >= 0: reservation successful, set TTL = 10 minutes
- If result < 0: item unavailable, INCR back immediately
- Redis is single-threaded: DECR is atomic, no race conditions

**Phase 2 - Confirmation (at "Place Order")**:
- Convert reservation to order: write to DB, clear Redis reservation
- If checkout abandoned (TTL expires): Redis key expires, reservation released

**Why Not Just Lock the DB Row?**:
- Row-level locks under high concurrency = contention and timeouts
- Redis DECR is O(1) and lock-free: handles 100K ops/sec easily
- DB write happens only for confirmed orders (much lower volume)

**Edge Cases**:
- Redis failure: fall back to DB-level SELECT FOR UPDATE (slower but correct)
- Split payment: reservation held until all payment steps complete
- Multi-item order: all-or-nothing reservation (reserve all or release all)`
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you handle Black Friday traffic spikes?',
        answer: `**Pre-Event Preparation (weeks before)**:
- Identify high-traffic stores (based on last year + merchant forecasts)
- Pre-scale their pods: additional app servers, read replicas, expanded cache
- Pre-warm CDN: crawl storefronts, cache all product pages and images
- Load test checkout pipeline at 10x expected peak

**During Event - Auto-Scaling**:
- Monitor per-pod metrics: request rate, latency, error rate, DB connections

    description: 'Design a system for time-limited sales with extremely limited inventory and millions of concurrent buyers.',

    introduction: `Flash sales (also known as "lightning deals" or "drop" events) are time-limited sales where a small quantity of items is sold at a steep discount to a massive, eager audience. Think Amazon Prime Day deals, Supreme drops, or concert ticket releases. The defining characteristic is an extreme imbalance: millions of users competing for hundreds or thousands of items in seconds.

This creates one of the most challenging concurrency problems in system design: the system must handle a traffic spike of 100-1000x normal load, ensure exactly the right number of items are sold (no overselling, no underselling), maintain fairness (no automated bots jumping the queue), and survive gracefully even if components fail.

The key insight is that this is fundamentally a rate-limiting and queuing problem, not a traditional e-commerce problem. Most requests will be rejected (inventory exhausted), and the system must reject them as early and cheaply as possible.`,

    keyQuestions: [
      {
        question: 'How do you prevent overselling with millions of concurrent requests?',
        answer: `**Redis Atomic DECR Pattern**:

\`\`\`
# Before sale: SET sale:123:remaining 1000

# On purchase attempt:
remaining = DECR sale:123:remaining
if remaining >= 0:
    # SUCCESS: create reservation
    # SET reservation:{uuid} = {userId, saleId}, EXPIRE 300
elif remaining < 0:
    # SOLD OUT: increment back to prevent underflow
    INCR sale:123:remaining
    return "sold out"
\`\`\`

**Why This Works**:
- Redis DECR is atomic and single-threaded: no race conditions possible
- O(1) per operation, handles 1M+ ops/sec on a single Redis instance
- No locks, no transactions, no contention
- The counter can briefly go negative (two requests DECR simultaneously), but the INCR correction ensures it settles at 0

**Why Not a Database?**:
- SELECT FOR UPDATE on a single row = serial execution = ~1000 ops/sec max
- Distributed locks (Redlock) add latency and complexity
- Redis DECR is 1000x faster and simpler

**Restock on Expiration**:
- Reservation has 5-minute TTL
- Background worker scans expired reservations: INCR sale:123:remaining
- This returns inventory for users who didn't complete payment`
      },
      {
        question: 'How does the waiting room and queue work?',
        answer: `**Pre-Sale Waiting Room**:
1. Before sale time: CDN serves a static page with a countdown timer
2. Page auto-refreshes or uses WebSocket for "sale started" signal
3. No requests hit origin servers during countdown (pure CDN)

**Queue Entry (at sale start)**:
1. Client sends request to queue service
2. Queue service assigns position using Redis INCR: \`INCR sale:123:queue_position\`
3. Returns position + estimated wait time
4. Client polls or receives WebSocket update when it's their turn

**Admission Control**:
- Process queue in batches: admit 1000 users per second to the purchase endpoint
- Rate shaped by: inventory remaining * (avg payment time)
- If inventory = 500 and avg payment = 30 seconds: admit at 500/30 = ~17/sec

**Fairness Guarantees**:
- Position determined by arrival time (INCR is ordered)
- Each user gets exactly one position (deduplicated by userId)
- Queue position is not transferable

**Skip the Queue (VIP / Loyalty)**:
- Priority queue: VIP users get positions in a separate, faster lane
- Implementation: two Redis counters, drain VIP queue first until empty`
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you detect and prevent bots?',
        answer: `**Multi-Layer Bot Defense**:

**Layer 1 - CAPTCHA (pre-sale)**:
- Require CAPTCHA solve to enter the waiting room
- Use proof-of-work challenge that takes 2-3 seconds (prevents automated solving)
- CAPTCHA token valid for 10 minutes, single-use

**Layer 2 - Rate Limiting**:
- Per-IP: max 5 requests/sec to purchase endpoint
- Per-user: max 1 purchase attempt per sale
- Per device fingerprint: max 3 accounts per device

**Layer 3 - Behavioral Analysis**:
- Time-to-click after sale starts: <100ms is suspicious (human reaction time ~200ms)
- Request pattern: identical timing intervals = bot
- Browser fingerprint: headless Chrome, Selenium markers
- Mouse movement/touch events: bots don't generate realistic interaction patterns

**Layer 4 - Account Reputation**:
- New account (created <24h before sale): flagged, extra verification
- Account with history of abandoned reservations: throttled
- Account linked to known bot IPs: blocked

**Enforcement**:
- Suspicious requests get a fake "queued" response (honeypot)
- Confirmed bots: cancel their reservations, restock inventory
- Post-sale audit: cancel orders from detected bot accounts, refund and restock`

    introduction: `Digital wallets like Venmo, Cash App, and PayPal are financial systems that require extremely high correctness guarantees. Unlike most distributed systems where eventual consistency is acceptable, financial systems must ensure that money is never created or destroyed: every debit must have a corresponding credit, and the total money in the system must always balance.

The core technical challenge is implementing double-entry bookkeeping in a distributed system while maintaining high availability. Every transaction involves at least two account balance changes that must happen atomically. When you send $50 to a friend, your balance must decrease by $50 AND their balance must increase by $50 -- partial completion is unacceptable.

Additional challenges include: integrating with external banking networks (ACH, card networks), fraud detection in real-time, regulatory compliance (KYC/AML), and handling disputes and reversals.`,

      {
        question: 'How does double-entry bookkeeping work in this system?',
        answer: `**The Golden Rule**: Every transaction creates exactly two ledger entries that sum to zero.

**P2P Transfer ($50 from Alice to Bob)**:
\`\`\`
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
-- Debit Alice's wallet
INSERT INTO ledger_entries (transaction_id, wallet_id, entry_type, amount, balance_after)
  VALUES ('tx-123', 'alice', 'debit', 50.00, 150.00);
UPDATE wallets SET balance = balance - 50.00 WHERE id = 'alice' AND balance >= 50.00;

-- Credit Bob's wallet
INSERT INTO ledger_entries (transaction_id, wallet_id, entry_type, amount, balance_after)
  VALUES ('tx-123', 'bob', 'credit', 50.00, 250.00);
UPDATE wallets SET balance = balance + 50.00 WHERE id = 'bob';
COMMIT;
\`\`\`

**Why Double-Entry?**:
- Audit trail: every balance change is traceable to a specific transaction
- Self-checking: sum of all debits must equal sum of all credits (invariant)
- Debugging: if totals don't balance, you know something is wrong

**Reconciliation** (daily background job):
- Sum all credit entries across all wallets
- Sum all debit entries across all wallets
- If credits != debits -> alert, investigate, fix
- Also: sum all wallet balances = total deposits - total withdrawals`
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you handle bank operations that take days?',
        answer: `**Saga Pattern for ACH Top-Up**:

**Step 1 - Initiate** (immediate):
- Create transaction record: status = "pending"
- Add pending_balance to user's wallet (visible but not spendable)
- Submit ACH request to banking partner API

**Step 2 - Wait** (1-3 business days):
- Banking partner processes the ACH transfer
- Webhook notification when transfer completes or fails

**Step 3a - Success**:
- Move amount from pending_balance to available balance
- Create ledger entries: debit "external_funds" account, credit user wallet
- Update transaction status to "completed"
- Send user notification

**Step 3b - Failure** (compensating transaction):
- Reverse pending_balance addition
- Update transaction status to "failed"
- Create ledger entries that cancel the pending entries
- Notify user of failure

**Withdrawal Saga** is similar but reversed:
- Immediately debit wallet balance
- If ACH fails: compensating credit restores the balance
- "Returned" withdrawals (e.g., invalid bank account) handled same way

**Key Principle**: The saga maintains consistency across the async boundary. At every point, either the forward transaction or the compensating transaction has run.`
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you prevent duplicate transactions?',
        answer: `**Idempotency Key Pattern**:

**Client Side**:
- Before every API call, client generates a unique idempotency_key (UUID)
- If request times out or fails, client retries with THE SAME key

**Server Side**:
\`\`\`python
def process_transfer(request):
    key = request.idempotency_key

    # Check Redis for existing result
    cached = redis.get(f"idemp:{key}")
    if cached:
        return cached  # Return original result, no re-processing

    # Process the transfer
    result = execute_transfer(request)

    # Store result in Redis with 24h TTL
    redis.set(f"idemp:{key}", result, ex=86400)

    # Also store in DB for longer-term dedup
    insert_idempotency_record(key, result)

    return result
\`\`\`

**Why This Matters**:
- Network timeout: client didn't receive response but server processed it
- Without idempotency: retry = double charge (user loses $50 twice)
- With idempotency: retry returns original result (correct behavior)

**Database-Level Protection** (belt and suspenders):
- Unique constraint on (from_wallet_id, idempotency_key)
- Even if Redis fails, DB prevents duplicate transactions
- Transaction isolation level: SERIALIZABLE for critical paths`

    introduction: `A stock exchange is one of the most latency-sensitive systems in existence. The matching engine -- the core component that pairs buy and sell orders -- must process orders in microseconds, not milliseconds. Modern exchanges like NASDAQ handle millions of orders per second with deterministic latency.

The system has two primary subsystems: the order matching engine (which must be single-threaded per symbol for correctness and fairness) and the market data distribution system (which must broadcast price updates to millions of subscribers in real-time). These have opposite scaling characteristics: the matching engine must be fast and sequential, while data distribution must be parallel and fan-out-heavy.

Key constraints include regulatory requirements for fairness (orders must be processed in strict time order), audit trails (every order and match must be recorded), and fault tolerance (the exchange must recover from failures without losing any orders or corrupting the order book).`,

\`\`\`
Bids (buy orders):           Asks (sell orders):
Price  | Orders (FIFO)       Price  | Orders (FIFO)
-------|------------------   -------|------------------
$150.50| [B1:100, B2:50]    $150.55| [A1:200]

$150.40| [B4:200, B5:100]   $150.75| [A4:500]
\`\`\`

**Matching a new Sell Limit Order: Sell 250 @ $150.45**:
1. Best bid = $150.50 >= limit price $150.45? YES -> match
2. Fill B1 (100 shares @ $150.50) -> Trade! Remaining: 150
3. Fill B2 (50 shares @ $150.50) -> Trade! Remaining: 100
4. Next bid = $150.45 >= $150.45? YES -> match
5. Fill B3 partially (100 of 300 shares @ $150.45) -> Trade! Remaining: 0
6. Order fully filled. B3 has 200 shares remaining on the book.

**Time Complexity**:
- Match: O(1) to find best price (sorted tree), O(k) where k = orders matched
- Insert: O(log P) where P = number of price levels
- Cancel: O(1) with order ID -> pointer lookup (hash map)

**Market Order**: Same algorithm but no price limit -> fills at whatever price is available (dangerous in thin markets)`
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you achieve microsecond-level latency?',
        answer: `**Hardware Optimizations**:
- **Kernel bypass (DPDK)**: network packets go directly to user-space, skipping the OS kernel (~5us saved)
- **RDMA**: remote direct memory access for inter-server communication without CPU involvement
- **NVMe SSDs**: WAL writes complete in <10us (vs ~1ms for regular SSDs)
- **CPU pinning**: matching engine thread pinned to a specific core, no context switches
- **NUMA-aware memory**: allocate memory on the same NUMA node as the pinned CPU core

**Software Optimizations**:
- **Single-threaded**: no locks, no synchronization overhead
- **Pre-allocated memory**: no heap allocation during order processing (object pools)
- **Lock-free data structures**: for the rare shared state (e.g., sequence counters)
- **Batched I/O**: accumulate market data updates, send in batches every 10us
- **JIT compilation**: hot paths compiled to native code (if using JVM)

**What NOT to do**:
- No garbage collection pauses (use C/C++/Rust, or tune JVM GC carefully)
- No syscalls on the hot path (pre-open all file descriptors, pre-allocate all buffers)
- No logging on the hot path (buffer log entries, flush asynchronously)
- No dynamic memory allocation (everything pre-allocated at startup)

**Typical Latency Budget**: Gateway receive: 1us + deserialize: 1us + match: 2-5us + serialize: 1us + send: 1us = ~7-10us total`
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you handle fault tolerance without adding latency?',
        answer: `**Replicated State Machine Approach**:

**Primary-Secondary Architecture**:
- Primary matching engine processes all orders
- 2 secondary engines receive the same order stream (via Raft or custom replication)
- Secondaries maintain identical order book state but do NOT send responses

**Replication Protocol**:
1. Sequencer assigns sequence number to incoming order
2. Order written to shared log (replicated across 3 nodes)
3. Primary processes order, generates trades
4. Response sent after order is durably logged (not after replication completes)
5. Secondaries process the same order from the log, reach identical state

**Failover (< 1 second)**:
1. Primary failure detected via heartbeat (100ms timeout)
2. Secondary with latest sequence number becomes new primary
3. Replays any orders that primary acknowledged but secondary hasn't processed
4. Deterministic replay: same orders + same sequence = same order book state
5. Gateway redirects traffic to new primary

**Why Deterministic Replay Works**:
- Matching is a pure function of: order book state + incoming order
- No randomness, no external dependencies, no timestamps in matching logic
- Given the same sequence of orders, any engine produces identical results

**WAL for Crash Recovery**:
- Every order event written to local NVMe WAL before processing
- On restart: replay WAL from last checkpoint to rebuild order book
- Checkpoint: serialize full order book state every 60 seconds`

    description: 'Design an API gateway that serves as the single entry point for microservices, handling routing, authentication, rate limiting, and request transformation.',

    introduction: `An API Gateway is the front door to a microservices architecture. Every external request passes through it, making it one of the most critical infrastructure components. It centralizes cross-cutting concerns like authentication, rate limiting, protocol translation, and request routing so that individual microservices can focus purely on business logic.

The design challenge is that the gateway sits on the critical path of every request, so it must add minimal latency while handling enormous throughput. It must also be highly available -- if the gateway goes down, the entire system is inaccessible. At the same time, it needs to be flexible enough to support diverse routing rules, multiple authentication schemes, and per-client rate limits.

Key trade-offs include: how much logic to put in the gateway (thin vs. fat gateway), how to handle gateway failures (redundancy strategy), and how to update routing configuration without downtime (hot reloading vs. rolling deploys).`,

    keyQuestions: [
      {
        question: 'How does distributed rate limiting work?',
        answer: `**Sliding Window Counter in Redis**:

**Algorithm** (per consumer, per endpoint):
\`\`\`
# Window = 1 second, limit = 100 requests/sec
key = "rl:{consumerId}:{endpoint}:{current_second}"

count = INCR key
if count == 1:
    EXPIRE key 2  # auto-cleanup after 2 seconds

if count > 100:
    return 429 Too Many Requests
    Headers: X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0, Retry-After: <ms to next window>
else:
    forward request
    Headers: X-RateLimit-Remaining: {100 - count}
\`\`\`

**Why Sliding Window?** (vs fixed window):
- Fixed window: consumer sends 100 requests at 0:59, 100 more at 1:01 = 200 in 2 seconds
- Sliding window: uses weighted average of current and previous window counts
- \`effective_count = prev_count * (1 - elapsed/window) + current_count\`

**Distributed Consistency**:
- All gateway instances hit the same Redis key -> globally consistent count
- Redis INCR is atomic -> no race conditions
- Trade-off: adds ~0.5ms per request for Redis round-trip
- Optimization: local counter + periodic sync (less accurate but faster)

**Multiple Tiers**:
- Per-consumer: 100 req/sec (business plan)
- Per-endpoint: 10K req/sec (protect backend)
- Global: 1M req/sec (infrastructure protection)`
      },
      {
        question: 'How does the circuit breaker pattern work?',
        answer: `**Three States**:

**Closed** (normal operation):
- Requests forwarded to upstream service
- Track failure rate in sliding window
- If failure rate > threshold (e.g., 50% of last 20 requests): -> OPEN

**Open** (service is down, fail fast):
- All requests immediately rejected with 503
- Do NOT forward to failing service (prevent cascading failure)
- After timeout (e.g., 30 seconds): -> HALF-OPEN

**Half-Open** (testing recovery):
- Allow 1-3 probe requests through to upstream
- If probes succeed: -> CLOSED (service recovered)
- If probes fail: -> OPEN (reset timeout)

**Shared State (distributed)**:
\`\`\`
Redis:
  circuit:{upstream}:state = "open"
  circuit:{upstream}:failures = 12  (TTL: 60s)
  circuit:{upstream}:successes = 3
  circuit:{upstream}:opened_at = timestamp
\`\`\`

**Why Shared?**:
- 10 gateway instances: each sees 1/10th of traffic
- If only local state: each instance independently determines service health
- Shared state: collective view, faster detection, consistent behavior

**Fallback Options** when circuit is open:
- Return cached response (if GET request and cache available)
- Return degraded response (partial data from alternative source)
- Return error with retry-after header`
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you handle configuration changes without downtime?',
        answer: `**Control Plane Push Model**:

**Architecture**:
\`\`\`
Admin API -> Config DB (etcd) -> Control Plane -> gRPC Stream -> Gateway Instances
\`\`\`

**Change Flow**:
1. Admin updates route via API: POST /admin/routes
2. Config written to etcd with version number
3. Control plane detects change (etcd watch)
4. Control plane pushes delta to all gateways via persistent gRPC stream
5. Each gateway atomically swaps its in-memory route table
6. New requests use new routes; in-flight requests complete on old routes

**Atomic Swap**:
- Gateway maintains two route tables: active and pending
- New config builds the pending table
- Single pointer swap makes pending the active table
- Old table garbage collected after in-flight requests drain

**Rollback Safety**:
- Every config change is versioned
- If error rate spikes after change: auto-rollback to previous version
- Canary deployment: apply change to 1 gateway first, monitor, then roll out

**Zero-Downtime Guarantee**:
- No process restart needed
- No connection drops (existing connections unaffected)
- Change propagation: <1 second to all gateway instances
- Worst case: brief inconsistency where some gateways have new config, others old (converges in <1s)`

    introduction: `Distributed caching is a foundational infrastructure component that sits between application servers and databases, reducing latency from milliseconds (database query) to microseconds (memory access). Systems like Redis and Memcached are used in virtually every large-scale web application.

The core challenge is distributing cached data across multiple nodes while handling node failures, data rebalancing, and cache coherence. When a cache node is added or removed, the system must minimize the number of keys that need to be remapped (this is where consistent hashing becomes essential).

Additional challenges include: choosing the right eviction policy when memory is full, maintaining cache coherence (when the underlying data changes), replication for high availability, and handling the "thundering herd" problem when a popular cache key expires and hundreds of requests simultaneously hit the database.`,

    keyQuestions: [
      {
        question: 'How does consistent hashing with virtual nodes work?',
        answer: `**Hash Ring Concept**:
- Hash space is a ring from 0 to 2^32
- Each physical node placed at multiple points (virtual nodes) on the ring
- A key is hashed, then walks clockwise to find its owning node

**Example**: 3 physical nodes, 4 virtual nodes each = 12 points on ring
\`\`\`
Ring: ... [N1-v2] ... [N3-v1] ... [N2-v3] ... [N1-v4] ...
Key "user:123" hashes to position X
Walk clockwise from X -> first virtual node found = owner
\`\`\`

**Why Virtual Nodes?**:
- 3 physical nodes with 1 point each: wildly uneven distribution (one node might get 60% of keys)
- 3 nodes with 200 virtual nodes each: nearly perfect distribution (each gets ~33% ± 2%)
- More virtual nodes = better balance, but more memory for the ring data structure

**Node Addition (adding Node 4)**:
- Place Node 4's virtual nodes on the ring
- Keys between each new virtual node and its predecessor belong to Node 4
- Only ~1/4 of keys move (those in the ranges now owned by Node 4)
- Other 3/4 of keys: completely unaffected

**Node Removal**:
- Remove Node 3's virtual nodes from ring
- Keys that belonged to Node 3 now fall to the next clockwise node
- Only Node 3's keys are redistributed (~1/3 of total keys)`
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you handle the thundering herd problem?',
        answer: `**The Problem**:
- Popular key (e.g., celebrity profile) cached with TTL
- Key expires at time T
- 10,000 requests arrive in the next 100ms, all get cache miss
- All 10,000 hit the database simultaneously -> database overloaded

**Solution 1: Cache Lease (best approach)**:
\`\`\`
value = cache.GET(key)
if value is MISS:
    lease = cache.SET_LEASE(key, timeout=5s)
    if lease granted (first requester):
        value = database.query(key)
        cache.SET(key, value, ttl=300)
    else (subsequent requesters):
        wait(100ms)
        retry cache.GET(key)  # lease holder will have populated it
\`\`\`
- Only ONE request reaches the database
- Others wait briefly and read from cache

**Solution 2: Stale-While-Revalidate**:
- When TTL expires, serve stale value while ONE request refreshes in background
- No requests ever hit the database stampede
- Trade-off: briefly serves stale data

**Solution 3: Probabilistic Early Expiration**:
- Each request has a small probability of triggering refresh before TTL
- \`should_refresh = random() < (time_remaining / total_ttl) * factor\`
- Popular keys: refreshed early by one of many requesters
- Less popular keys: refresh naturally at TTL`
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you choose between LRU, LFU, and TTL eviction?',
        answer: `**LRU (Least Recently Used)**:
- Evict the key that hasn't been accessed for the longest time
- Good for: temporal locality (recently accessed = likely accessed again)
- Implementation: doubly linked list + hash map, O(1) for all operations
- Weakness: one-time scan of many keys pollutes the cache (scan resistance)

**LFU (Least Frequently Used)**:
- Evict the key with the fewest accesses
- Good for: skewed popularity (some keys are consistently hot)
- Implementation: frequency count + min-heap or frequency-indexed linked lists
- Weakness: keys with historically high count but no longer popular stay cached (stale popularity)

**TTL (Time-To-Live)**:
- Keys automatically expire after a set duration
- Good for: data with known freshness requirements
- Often combined with LRU/LFU for when memory is full before TTL expires

**Redis's Approach (recommended)**:
- allkeys-lru: LRU across all keys (most common choice)
- volatile-lfu: LFU only among keys with TTL set
- Sampling-based approximation: don't track access order for ALL keys
  - On eviction: sample 10 random keys, evict the LRU among them
  - Much less memory overhead than maintaining a full LRU list
  - Surprisingly close to perfect LRU in practice

**Recommendation by Workload**:
- Web sessions: TTL (known expiration)
- Database query cache: LRU (temporal locality)
- Content recommendation: LFU (popular items stay cached)
- Mixed: allkeys-lru with TTL on time-sensitive keys`

    introduction: `A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers that cache content closer to end users. CDNs serve 50-90% of all internet traffic today, handling everything from static assets (images, CSS, JS) to video streaming and even dynamic API responses.

The fundamental challenge is maintaining cache consistency across hundreds of Points of Presence (PoPs) worldwide while minimizing the distance (and therefore latency) between users and content. A user in Tokyo should be served from a nearby PoP, not from an origin server in Virginia.

CDN design involves three key subsystems: the request routing system (directing users to the optimal PoP), the caching layer (deciding what to cache, when to evict, and when to purge), and the origin shield layer (protecting origin servers from being overwhelmed by cache misses from hundreds of PoPs).`,

    keyQuestions: [
      {
        question: 'How does request routing work to direct users to the optimal PoP?',
        answer: `**Option 1: Anycast (preferred for CDNs)**:
- All edge PoPs advertise the same IP prefix via BGP
- Internet routing naturally directs packets to the nearest PoP
- Pros: automatic, no DNS TTL issues, handles PoP failure (BGP withdraws route)
- Cons: routing is based on network topology (hops), not actual latency

**Option 2: GeoDNS**:
- DNS server maps client IP to geographic location
- Returns IP of the nearest PoP based on geo-database
- Pros: can incorporate real-time latency measurements
- Cons: DNS caching means clients may use stale PoP assignment

**Option 3: Latency-Based (hybrid)**:
- Client-side JavaScript measures latency to multiple PoPs
- Subsequent requests directed to the lowest-latency PoP
- Used by sophisticated CDNs for fine-tuning after initial anycast routing

**Failover**:
- Health checker monitors each PoP (synthetic requests every 10s)
- Unhealthy PoP: BGP withdraws its route announcement (anycast) or DNS stops returning its IP (GeoDNS)
- Traffic shifts to next-nearest healthy PoP within seconds (anycast) or DNS TTL (GeoDNS)

**Real-World**: Most CDNs use anycast for initial routing + real-time performance data for optimization`
      },
      {
        question: 'How does the origin shield tier work?',
        answer: `**The Problem Without Shield**:
- 200 edge PoPs, each with independent caches
- Popular content cached at all edges (great hit rate)
- Long-tail content: cache miss at multiple edges simultaneously
- 50 edges miss on same URL at same time -> 50 requests to origin

**Origin Shield Solution**:
- 10-15 regional shield PoPs placed between edges and origin
- Edge cache miss -> goes to regional shield (NOT to origin)
- Shield cache miss -> goes to origin (only 1 request per region)

**Request Flow**:
\`\`\`
User -> Edge PoP (SFO) -> [HIT] -> serve
User -> Edge PoP (SFO) -> [MISS] -> Shield (US-West) -> [HIT] -> serve, cache at edge
User -> Edge PoP (SFO) -> [MISS] -> Shield (US-West) -> [MISS] -> Origin -> serve, cache at shield + edge
\`\`\`

**Shield Assignment**:
- Each edge PoP is assigned to one shield PoP (based on network proximity)
- US-West edges -> US-West shield
- EU edges -> EU shield
- This ensures request coalescing: all US-West edges funnel misses through one shield

**Origin Load Reduction**:
- Without shield: origin sees O(PoPs) requests per unique URL
- With shield: origin sees O(regions) requests per unique URL
- 200 PoPs, 10 regions -> 20x reduction in origin load

**Request Coalescing at Shield**:
- Multiple edges miss on same URL simultaneously
- Shield receives multiple requests for same URL
- Only the FIRST request goes to origin
- Subsequent requests wait for the first to complete, then all served from shield cache`
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you handle cache invalidation across 200+ PoPs?',
        answer: `**Push-Based Invalidation Fanout**:

**Invalidation Request Flow**:
1. Customer calls API: \`POST /invalidations { paths: ["/images/*"] }\`
2. Control plane writes invalidation to central store
3. Control plane pushes to shield PoPs (10 nodes, parallel)
4. Each shield pushes to its assigned edge PoPs (20 nodes each, parallel)
5. Total propagation: 2 hops * ~1s each = ~2-3 seconds globally

**At Each PoP**:
- Receive invalidation pattern (e.g., "/images/*")
- Walk cache index, mark matching entries as invalidated
- Marked entries: serve stale with background revalidation (optional) or reject immediately
- Do NOT delete from disk (expensive): let normal eviction reclaim space

**Invalidation Types**:
- **Path-based**: invalidate all URLs matching a glob pattern
- **Tag-based**: objects tagged at creation, invalidate by tag (e.g., "product:123")
- **Purge all**: nuclear option, clears entire cache for a distribution

**Consistency Guarantees**:
- "Best effort within 5 seconds": not instant, but very fast
- During propagation window: some PoPs may serve stale content (acceptable for most use cases)
- For strong consistency needs: use Cache-Control: no-cache (forces origin validation on every request)

**Monitoring**:
- Track invalidation progress: how many PoPs have processed each invalidation
- Alert if propagation takes >10 seconds (indicates network or PoP health issues)
- Invalidation rate limiting: prevent customers from invalidating too frequently (cache thrashing)`

    introduction: `Object storage (like Amazon S3) is the backbone of the modern internet. It stores everything from user-uploaded images to data lake files to application backups. S3 alone stores over 200 trillion objects. The defining characteristic is extreme durability: S3 promises 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability, meaning if you store 10 million objects, you'd statistically lose one object every 10,000 years.

Unlike file systems (hierarchical, mutable) or block storage (fixed-size blocks), object storage uses a flat namespace of immutable objects addressed by key. This simplicity enables massive horizontal scaling because there's no directory tree to maintain consistency on and no file locking needed.

The key engineering challenges are: achieving 11-nines durability through replication and erasure coding, managing metadata for trillions of objects, handling multi-part uploads for huge files, and providing strong consistency (S3 achieved strong read-after-write consistency in 2020, which is architecturally non-trivial at this scale).`,

        question: 'How does erasure coding achieve 11-nines durability?',
        answer: `**Reed-Solomon Erasure Coding (6+3 example)**:
- Object split into 6 data fragments
- 3 parity fragments computed (mathematical redundancy)
- 9 fragments placed on 9 different storage nodes (different racks/zones)

**Durability Math**:
- Object is lost only if 4+ of 9 fragments are simultaneously unavailable
- P(single fragment loss) = 0.01 (1% per year, industry average for disk failure)
- P(4+ fragments lost simultaneously) ≈ C(9,4) * 0.01^4 * 0.99^5 ≈ 1.25 × 10^-8
- With repair (fragments reconstructed within hours of failure): effectively < 10^-11

**Comparison with 3-Way Replication**:
- Replication: 3 copies, data lost if all 3 fail -> P ≈ 10^-6 (6 nines)
- Erasure coding 6+3: 9 fragments, data lost if 4+ fail -> P ≈ 10^-11 (11 nines)
- Storage overhead: replication = 3x, erasure coding = 1.5x (9/6)
- Erasure coding is both MORE durable AND MORE space-efficient

**Repair Process**:
- Background process monitors fragment health (heartbeats, checksums)
- When a fragment is lost (node dies): reconstruct from any 6 of remaining 8 fragments
- Place reconstructed fragment on a new healthy node
- Repair window: <6 hours (the shorter, the more durable the system)`

        question: 'How do you achieve strong read-after-write consistency?',
        answer: `**The Challenge**:
- PUT completes at time T
- GET at time T+1ms must return the new object (not stale or "not found")
- In a distributed system with replication, this is hard

**Solution: Paxos-Based Metadata Writes**:

**Write Path (PUT)**:
1. Client sends object to front-end server
2. Front-end writes data fragments to storage nodes (erasure coded)
3. Front-end proposes metadata write to Paxos group for that key's shard
4. Paxos group achieves consensus (majority acknowledges)
5. PUT response sent to client only after Paxos commits

**Read Path (GET)**:
1. Client sends GET to front-end server
2. Front-end reads metadata from Paxos group (reads from leader or quorum)
3. Metadata includes data locations; front-end fetches data fragments
4. Returns object to client

**Why This Guarantees Consistency**:
- PUT only succeeds after Paxos consensus (metadata is committed)
- GET reads from the same Paxos group (sees all committed writes)
- No stale reads possible: every read sees every completed write

**Performance Impact**:
- Write latency slightly higher (Paxos round-trip: ~5-10ms additional)
- Read latency: can read from Paxos leader (no quorum needed for reads if leader has latest state)
- Trade-off is worth it: strong consistency eliminates an entire class of application bugs`

        question: 'How does multipart upload work for large objects?',
        answer: `**Protocol** (for objects >100MB, required >5GB):

**Phase 1 - Initiate**:
\`\`\`
POST /bucket/large-file.zip?uploads
Response: { uploadId: "abc-123" }
\`\`\`

**Phase 2 - Upload Parts** (parallel):
\`\`\`
PUT /bucket/large-file.zip?partNumber=1&uploadId=abc-123  [body: 100MB]
PUT /bucket/large-file.zip?partNumber=2&uploadId=abc-123  [body: 100MB]
...
PUT /bucket/large-file.zip?partNumber=50&uploadId=abc-123 [body: 50MB]
// Parts can be uploaded in any order, in parallel, from different clients
\`\`\`

**Phase 3 - Complete**:
\`\`\`
POST /bucket/large-file.zip?uploadId=abc-123
Body: { parts: [{partNumber: 1, ETag: "..."}, {partNumber: 2, ETag: "..."}, ...] }
// Server assembles parts into final object
\`\`\`

**Why Multipart?**:
- Resumability: if a part fails, retry just that part (not the whole 5TB file)
- Parallelism: upload multiple parts simultaneously (saturate network bandwidth)
- Memory efficiency: server handles one part at a time, doesn't buffer entire file

**Server-Side Handling**:
- Each part stored independently (like a temporary small object)
- On complete: create final object metadata pointing to all parts in order
- Parts are already erasure-coded individually -> final object doesn't need re-encoding
- Abort: if upload not completed within 7 days, parts garbage collected

**Integrity**:
- Each part has its own ETag (MD5 hash)
- Final object ETag = MD5(concatenation of part ETags) + "-" + partCount
- Client can verify each part and final object independently`

    description: 'Design a database optimized for time-stamped data with high write throughput and efficient range queries.',

    introduction: `Time series databases (TSDBs) are specialized storage systems for data that is indexed by time: metrics, IoT sensor readings, financial tick data, application logs, and more. The access pattern is distinctive: data is written once (append-only), read in time-range scans, and older data is accessed less frequently.

Standard databases handle time series data poorly because they are designed for random read/write access. TSDBs exploit the unique characteristics of time series data: it arrives in roughly chronological order, it is rarely updated after writing, and queries almost always involve time-range filters with aggregation (e.g., "average CPU usage per minute for the last 24 hours").

The key engineering challenge is sustaining high write throughput (millions of data points per second) while supporting fast range queries with aggregation. The LSM-tree (Log-Structured Merge Tree) storage engine is the foundation, combined with time-based partitioning and columnar compression.`,

    keyQuestions: [
      {
        question: 'How does Gorilla compression achieve 10-20x compression?',
        answer: `**Timestamp Compression (delta-of-delta)**:
- Timestamps arrive at regular intervals (e.g., every 10 seconds)
- First timestamp: stored as full 64-bit value
- Subsequent: store delta from previous (e.g., 10, 10, 10, 10...)
- Delta-of-delta: store difference of deltas (e.g., 0, 0, 0, 0...)
- Most delta-of-deltas are 0: encode as single bit!
- Result: ~1-2 bits per timestamp (vs 64 bits uncompressed) = 32-64x compression

**Value Compression (XOR encoding)**:
- Consecutive readings of same metric are usually similar
- Example: CPU values 87.5, 87.3, 87.6, 87.4...
- XOR of consecutive float64 values: most bits are identical (XOR result has few 1-bits)
- Encode only the position and length of differing bits
- Result: ~5-10 bits per value (vs 64 bits uncompressed) = 6-12x compression

**Combined Effect**:
- Raw data point: 8 (timestamp) + 8 (value) = 16 bytes
- Compressed: ~0.5 (timestamp) + ~1.0 (value) = ~1.5 bytes per point
- Compression ratio: ~10x for typical metrics data

**Why This Works for Time Series**:
- Regular timestamps -> delta-of-delta is near-zero
- Slowly changing values -> XOR bits are mostly identical
- Other data types (random values, strings) compress much worse`
      },
      {
        question: 'How does the write path work for high throughput?',
        answer: `**LSM-Tree Write Path**:

**Step 1 - WAL + Memory Buffer**:
\`\`\`
Incoming data point -> Append to WAL (sequential disk write, ~1us)
                    -> Insert into in-memory buffer (sorted by series + time)
\`\`\`
- WAL ensures durability: if process crashes, replay WAL on restart
- Memory buffer: typically 256MB-1GB, holds minutes of data
- No disk seeks on write path -> can sustain millions of points/sec

**Step 2 - Flush to Disk (every few minutes or when buffer is full)**:
- Serialize buffer into an immutable SST (Sorted String Table) file
- Each SST file covers one time shard and contains columnar, compressed data
- New empty buffer starts accepting writes (double-buffering)

**Step 3 - Background Compaction**:
- Many small SST files accumulate over time
- Compaction merges them into fewer, larger files
- Removes any out-of-order data by re-sorting
- Applies Gorilla compression to the merged data

**Why This is Fast**:
- Writes are sequential (append to WAL, insert to sorted buffer): no random I/O
- No index updates on write (unlike B-tree): just append
- Compression happens during flush (batch operation), not per-write
- Single node can sustain 10M+ points/sec with SSD storage

**Batch Ingestion Optimization**:
- Clients send batches of 100-1000 points per request
- Server parses batch, inserts all points into buffer in one operation
- Amortizes network and parsing overhead across many points`

        question: 'How does downsampling and retention work?',
        answer: `**Time-Based Partitioning Enables Simple Retention**:

**Partition Strategy**:
\`\`\`
data/
  shard_2024-06-01/  -- all data for June 1
  shard_2024-06-02/  -- all data for June 2
  ...
  shard_2024-06-30/
\`\`\`

**Retention Policy**: "Keep raw data for 30 days"
- Implementation: \`rm -rf shard_older_than_30_days\`
- O(1) operation regardless of data volume!
- No expensive DELETE queries, no vacuum/compaction needed

**Downsampling Pipeline**:
1. Raw data: every 10 seconds (full resolution)
2. After 7 days: downsample to 1-minute aggregates (min, max, avg, count)
3. After 30 days: downsample to 1-hour aggregates
4. After 1 year: downsample to 1-day aggregates

**Implementation**:
- Background worker reads raw shard for day N-7
- Computes 1-minute rollups: GROUP BY series, floor(timestamp, 1m)
- Writes rollups to separate rollup table/shard
- Raw shard can then be deleted (or moved to cold storage)

**Query Routing**:
- Query for last 1 hour: read from raw data (full resolution)
- Query for last 7 days: read from 1-minute rollups
- Query for last year: read from 1-hour rollups
- Query engine automatically picks the appropriate resolution

**Storage Savings**:
- 1 year of raw data at 10s interval: 3.15M points per series
- 1-minute rollups: 525K points per series (6x reduction)
- 1-hour rollups: 8.7K points per series (360x reduction)
- 1-day rollups: 365 points per series (8,630x reduction)`

    description: 'Design a distributed locking service that provides mutual exclusion across processes and machines in a distributed system.',

    introduction: `Distributed locks enable mutual exclusion across multiple processes running on different machines -- a fundamental primitive for coordinating distributed systems. Use cases include: preventing double-processing of a job, ensuring only one instance modifies a shared resource, leader election, and rate-limiting distributed workers.

Unlike in-process locks (mutexes), distributed locks must handle partial failures: the lock holder can crash, the network can partition, and the lock service itself must be replicated for availability. The most dangerous failure mode is a "split-brain" where two processes both believe they hold the lock.

The key insight is that a correct distributed lock requires a consensus protocol (Paxos, Raft, ZAB) at its core. Simple approaches using a single Redis instance or database row can fail under network partitions. Martin Kleppmann's analysis of Redis Redlock highlights these subtleties.`,

        question: 'Why is a simple Redis lock insufficient and what are fencing tokens?',
        answer: `**The Stale Lock Holder Problem**:
\`\`\`
Time 0: Client A acquires lock (TTL=30s)
Time 0: Client A starts long GC pause (or network issue)
Time 31: Lock expires (TTL elapsed, A is still paused)
Time 32: Client B acquires lock, starts writing to shared resource
Time 33: Client A wakes up, STILL THINKS it holds the lock
Time 33: Client A writes to shared resource -> DATA CORRUPTION
\`\`\`

**Why TTL Alone Doesn't Work**:
- Client A has no way to know its lock expired while it was paused
- From A's perspective, it acquired the lock and never released it
- This is a fundamental issue with any TTL-based lock without fencing

**Fencing Token Solution**:
\`\`\`
Client A acquires lock -> fencing_token = 33
Client B acquires lock (after A's expires) -> fencing_token = 34

Client A wakes up, writes to storage with token=33
Storage sees: last_accepted_token = 34, received = 33
33 < 34 -> REJECTED (stale lock holder detected)
\`\`\`

**Why This Works**:
- Fencing tokens are monotonically increasing (guaranteed by Raft log index)
- The shared resource (database, file system) checks the token on every write
- A stale holder always has a lower token than the current holder
- This provides safety EVEN IF the lock service itself makes a mistake`

      {
        question: 'How does session-based locking work?',
        answer: `**Session Lifecycle**:

**Creation**:
- Client connects to lock service, receives sessionId
- Session has a TTL (e.g., 30 seconds)
- Client must send heartbeats every TTL/3 (10 seconds) to keep session alive

**Lock Acquisition**:
- Lock is associated with a session, not just a client ID
- If session expires -> all locks held by that session are automatically released
- This handles the "client crashes while holding lock" problem

**Session Expiration**:
\`\`\`
Client A: session TTL=30s, heartbeat every 10s
Time 0:  Heartbeat received, session renewed until T+30
Time 10: Heartbeat received, session renewed until T+40
Time 20: Client A crashes (no more heartbeats)
Time 40: Session expires on server (20s since last heartbeat)
Time 40: All of Client A's locks released
Time 40: Waiters notified, next in queue acquires lock
\`\`\`

**ZooKeeper Ephemeral Nodes**:
- Lock = ephemeral znode: /locks/my-resource/lock-0000000042
- Ephemeral = automatically deleted when the creating session ends
- Sequential = monotonically increasing suffix (natural fencing token!)
- Lock holder = client that created the znode with the LOWEST sequence number

**Fair Locking with Sequential Nodes**:
1. Client creates sequential ephemeral node: /locks/res/lock-0000000042
2. Client reads all children of /locks/res/
3. If my node is the lowest: I hold the lock
4. If not: watch the node just before mine (not ALL nodes -- avoids herd effect)
5. When watched node is deleted: re-check if I'm now the lowest`

        question: 'How does the Raft consensus protocol ensure correctness?',
        answer: `**Raft for Distributed Locks**:

**Cluster Setup**: 5 nodes (tolerates 2 failures)
- 1 Leader: handles all writes (lock acquire/release)
- 4 Followers: replicate leader's log

**Lock Acquisition Flow**:
1. Client sends ACQUIRE to leader
2. Leader appends to log: { term: 5, index: 142, cmd: ACQUIRE("my-lock", clientA) }
3. Leader replicates to followers (parallel RPCs)
4. 3 of 5 nodes acknowledge (majority) -> committed
5. Leader applies to state machine: lock acquired, fencing_token = 142
6. Leader responds to client: { fencingToken: 142, expiresAt: ... }

**Safety Guarantee**:
- Log entry 142 is committed -> it will never be undone
- Even if leader crashes after commit, new leader has the entry (majority has it)
- Fencing token = log index 142: guaranteed unique and increasing

**Leader Failure Handling**:
1. Leader crashes after committing but before responding to client
2. Client times out, retries with same idempotency key
3. New leader elected (has the committed entry)
4. Retry detected: returns original result (idempotent)

**Network Partition**:
- Minority partition: cannot form majority, cannot acquire locks (safe)
- Majority partition: continues operating normally
- When partition heals: minority nodes catch up from majority
- NO split-brain: lock can only be acquired through majority consensus

**Read Optimization (ReadIndex)**:
- Client wants to check lock status (read-only)
- Leader confirms it's still leader (one round of heartbeats)
- Then reads directly from state machine (no log replication needed)
- Provides linearizable reads without full Raft round-trip`

    introduction: `Distributed job schedulers orchestrate the execution of millions of scheduled tasks across a fleet of worker machines. Unlike a simple cron daemon on a single server, a distributed scheduler must handle: tasks that must run exactly once (no duplicates, no misses), scheduling across time zones, complex dependencies between tasks, and recovery when workers fail mid-execution.

Common use cases include: periodic data pipeline jobs (ETL), scheduled report generation, system maintenance tasks (backups, cleanups), delayed message delivery (send email in 24 hours if user hasn't responded), and recurring billing operations.

The core challenge is the combination of strict timing requirements (task must fire at the scheduled time), exactly-once execution semantics (no duplicates even if the scheduler itself fails), and scale (millions of pending tasks with heterogeneous schedules).`,

    keyQuestions: [
      {
        question: 'How do you guarantee exactly-once task execution?',
        answer: `**State Machine Approach**:

**Task Run States**: pending -> claimed -> running -> succeeded/failed

**Claim Protocol** (prevents duplicate dispatch):
\`\`\`sql
-- Atomic claim: only one scheduler can claim a task run
UPDATE task_runs
SET status = 'claimed', worker_id = 'worker-42', started_at = now()
WHERE id = 'run-123' AND status = 'pending'
-- If 0 rows affected: someone else claimed it (skip)
-- If 1 row affected: we own it (dispatch to worker)
\`\`\`

**Worker Lease Protocol** (handles worker failure):
- Worker receives task, starts execution
- Worker sends heartbeat every 10 seconds: "I'm still working on run-123"
- Server extends lease: run-123 expires at now + 30 seconds
- If no heartbeat in 30 seconds: task run marked as "timed_out", re-dispatched

**Idempotent Execution** (belt and suspenders):
- Each task run has a unique run_id
- Worker includes run_id in all side effects (database writes, API calls)
- Side-effect targets check for duplicate run_id: if seen, skip
- Even if a task accidentally runs twice, it produces the same result

**End-to-End Flow**:
1. Scheduler fires task -> inserts task_run (status: pending)
2. Scheduler claims task_run (atomic UPDATE)
3. Dispatcher sends to Kafka with run_id
4. Worker receives, executes with run_id for idempotency
5. Worker reports completion -> task_run status: succeeded
6. If worker dies: lease expires -> new task_run created (new attempt, same task)`
      },
      {
        question: 'How does the hierarchical time wheel work?',
        answer: `**Basic Time Wheel**:
- Circular array of N buckets, each representing a time slot
- Current time pointer advances every tick (e.g., every 100ms)
- Tasks in the current bucket are fired
- Insert: compute bucket = (fire_time / tick_size) % N -> O(1)
- Fire: process all tasks in current bucket -> O(tasks in bucket)

**Problem**: for large time ranges, need huge array
- 1-second granularity, 1-year range = 31M buckets (wasteful)

**Hierarchical Time Wheel** (like a clock with hours/minutes/seconds):
\`\`\`
Level 0 (seconds):  60 buckets, 1-second tick
Level 1 (minutes):  60 buckets, 1-minute tick
Level 2 (hours):    24 buckets, 1-hour tick
Level 3 (days):     365 buckets, 1-day tick
\`\`\`

**Insert Task "fire in 3 hours 25 minutes 10 seconds"**:
- Place in Level 2, bucket (current_hour + 3) % 24

**When Level 2 bucket fires (3 hours later)**:
- "Cascade down": move tasks to Level 1 (minute wheel)
- Task goes to Level 1, bucket 25

**When Level 1 bucket fires (25 minutes later)**:
- Cascade to Level 0 (second wheel)
- Task goes to Level 0, bucket 10

**When Level 0 bucket fires (10 seconds later)**:
- Task is dispatched to worker

**Complexity**:
- Insert: O(1) (compute which level and bucket, append)
- Fire: O(tasks in bucket) (no scanning)
- Total buckets: 60 + 60 + 24 + 365 = 509 (vs 31M for flat array)
- Memory: trivial (509 bucket headers)`
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you handle task dependencies?',
        answer: `**DAG-Based Dependency Resolution**:

**Modeling Dependencies**:
\`\`\`
Task A (extract data) -> Task B (transform) -> Task C (load)
                     \\-> Task D (validate) -/
\`\`\`
- This is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
- Task C runs only after both B and D complete

**Execution Protocol**:
1. When a task completes, check all tasks that depend on it
2. For each dependent task: are ALL its dependencies now complete?
3. If yes: task is now "ready" -> add to dispatch queue
4. If no: wait for remaining dependencies

**Implementation**:
\`\`\`sql
-- On task B completion:
SELECT t.id FROM tasks t
JOIN task_dependencies td ON td.task_id = t.id
WHERE td.depends_on_task_id = 'B'
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM task_dependencies td2
    JOIN task_runs tr ON tr.task_id = td2.depends_on_task_id
    WHERE td2.task_id = t.id
      AND tr.status != 'succeeded'
  )
-- Returns tasks whose ALL dependencies have succeeded
\`\`\`

**Failure Propagation**:
- If Task B fails: what happens to C and D?
- Option 1: "Fail fast" -- mark all downstream tasks as failed
- Option 2: "Best effort" -- only run tasks whose dependencies all succeeded, skip others
- Option 3: "Retry" -- retry B per its retry policy, only fail downstream after max retries

**Cycle Detection**:
- On task creation, validate that adding the dependency doesn't create a cycle
- Topological sort of the DAG: if sort fails (cycle detected), reject the task definition
- This is checked at task creation time, not execution time`

    introduction: `CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) systems are the backbone of modern software development, automatically building, testing, and deploying every code change. Systems like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and GitLab CI process millions of pipeline runs per day, each involving multiple stages of compilation, testing, artifact creation, and deployment.

The core challenge is orchestrating complex, multi-stage workflows where each stage may have different resource requirements (a Rust compilation needs lots of CPU and RAM; a Selenium test needs a browser environment), stages have dependencies (don't deploy if tests fail), and the system must scale to handle bursts of activity (Monday morning when everyone pushes their weekend work).

Key architectural decisions include: ephemeral vs. persistent build environments (containers vs. VMs vs. bare metal), artifact management and caching (recompiling unchanged dependencies is wasteful), secret management (builds need access to private registries and deployment credentials), and the build queue scheduling problem (prioritizing certain pipelines over others).`,

        question: 'How do you execute a multi-stage pipeline with dependencies?',
        answer: `**Pipeline YAML -> DAG -> Execution**:

**Example Pipeline**:
\`\`\`yaml
stages:
  install: { image: node:18, commands: [npm ci] }
  lint:    { image: node:18, commands: [npm run lint], needs: [install] }
  test:    { image: node:18, commands: [npm test], needs: [install] }
  build:   { image: node:18, commands: [npm run build], needs: [lint, test] }
  deploy:  { image: aws-cli, commands: [./deploy.sh], needs: [build] }
\`\`\`

**DAG Construction**:
\`\`\`
install -> lint  ─┐
       \\-> test ─┤-> build -> deploy
\`\`\`

**Execution Algorithm**:
1. Parse YAML, build dependency graph
2. Find all stages with no unmet dependencies -> "ready" set: {install}
3. Dispatch ready stages to workers (parallel)
4. When a stage completes:
   - Update its dependents' unmet dependency count
   - If a dependent's count reaches 0: add to ready set
5. Repeat until all stages complete or one fails

**Failure Handling**:
- If \`test\` fails: \`build\` and \`deploy\` are marked "skipped" (unrunnable)
- If \`lint\` fails but \`test\` succeeds: \`build\` still skipped (needs BOTH)
- Optional "allow_failure" flag: stage failure doesn't block dependents

**Optimization - Workspace Sharing**:
- \`install\` produces node_modules -> stages \`lint\`, \`test\`, \`build\` need it
- Workspace (filesystem snapshot) is captured after \`install\`
- Dependent stages start with that workspace (avoid re-installing)
- Implementation: tarball in S3 or shared volume mount`

  paths: [node_modules/]
\`\`\`

**Cache Flow**:

**On Stage Start**:
1. Compute cache key: hash of lock file content -> "node-modules-a1b2c3d4"
2. Check S3: does cache object exist at \`caches/repo-123/node-modules-a1b2c3d4.tar.zst\`?
3. If HIT: download and extract (10 seconds vs 2 minutes for npm install)
4. If MISS: proceed without cache

**On Stage Success**:
1. If cache key didn't exist (was a miss): archive cached paths
2. Upload to S3: \`caches/repo-123/node-modules-a1b2c3d4.tar.zst\` (zstd compressed)
3. Future runs with same lock file -> instant cache hit

**Cache Invalidation**:
- Automatic: when package-lock.json changes, hash changes -> new cache key
- Manual: API endpoint to clear caches for a repository
- TTL: caches expire after 7 days of no access (S3 lifecycle policy)

**Multi-Layer Caching**:
- L1: Worker local disk (fastest, survives between runs on same worker)
- L2: S3 (shared across all workers, survives worker replacement)
- Cache hit rate: 80-90% for established projects (lock files change rarely)

**Docker Layer Cache**:
- Workers keep Docker layer cache warm
- Custom base image (node:18 + common packages) pre-pulled on all workers
- Dockerfile cache: each layer is cached by its instruction hash
- "Warm worker" assignment: prefer dispatching to a worker that recently ran the same image`
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you handle secrets securely?',
        answer: `**Secret Lifecycle**:

**Storage**:
- Secrets stored in HashiCorp Vault (or similar KMS)
- Encrypted at rest with AES-256, key managed by HSM
- Access controlled per repository: repo X can only read its own secrets

**Injection at Runtime**:
1. Stage is about to start on worker
2. Worker requests secrets from Vault: "give me secrets for repo-123"
3. Vault authenticates worker (mutual TLS + IAM role)
4. Vault returns decrypted secrets
5. Worker injects as environment variables inside the container
6. Container process reads them like normal env vars

**Log Scrubbing** (critical):
- Build output is scanned for secret values before logging
- Pattern matching: if any log line contains a secret value, replace with "***"
- Also scrub: base64-encoded secrets, URL-encoded secrets, partial matches
- Defense in depth: scrubbing happens at both container sidecar and log ingestion

**What Secrets NEVER Touch**:
- Never written to disk inside the container (tmpfs only)
- Never included in Docker image layers
- Never passed as command-line arguments (visible in /proc)
- Never included in artifacts or cache archives
- Never visible in pipeline YAML (stored separately, referenced by name)

**Rotation**:
- Secrets can be rotated without changing pipeline config
- Old secret value remains valid for a grace period (ongoing runs)
- Vault audit log tracks every secret access (who, when, which pipeline run)`

    description: 'Design a calendar system supporting event scheduling, recurring events, multi-timezone support, and availability-based scheduling.',

    introduction: `Calendar systems are deceptively complex. On the surface, it's just storing events with start/end times. But recurring events (every Tuesday and Thursday, except holidays, ending after 50 occurrences), multi-timezone handling (a meeting at "3pm ET" shows as "12pm PT" for another participant), and free/busy availability queries across hundreds of participants make this a rich system design problem.

The core data model challenge is recurring events. A naive approach (materialize all instances of a recurring event) doesn't scale: a daily event for 10 years = 3,650 rows, and modifying the recurring series means updating all of them. The efficient approach uses a recurrence rule (RFC 5545 RRULE) and expands instances on-the-fly during queries.

The availability/scheduling problem is also interesting: "Find a 30-minute slot when Alice, Bob, and the Main Conference Room are all free in the next 2 weeks" requires computing the intersection of multiple calendars' free/busy intervals, potentially across different time zones.`,

        question: 'How do you handle recurring events efficiently?',
        answer: `**RRULE-Based Storage** (RFC 5545):

**Storage**: One row per recurring series
\`\`\`
Event: "Team Standup"
start_time: 2024-01-01 09:00 America/New_York
recurrence_rule: "FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,WE,FR;UNTIL=20241231"
\`\`\`

**On-The-Fly Expansion** (when rendering a calendar view):
\`\`\`python
def get_events(calendar_id, time_min, time_max):
    # 1. Get non-recurring events in range
    simple = SELECT * FROM events WHERE calendar_id = :cal
             AND start_time >= :min AND start_time < :max
             AND recurrence_rule IS NULL

    # 2. Get recurring events that MIGHT have instances in range
    recurring = SELECT * FROM events WHERE calendar_id = :cal
                AND recurrence_rule IS NOT NULL
                AND start_time < :max  -- started before range ends

    # 3. Expand each recurring event within the range
    expanded = []
    for event in recurring:
        instances = rrule_expand(event.recurrence_rule, event.start_time, time_min, time_max)
        expanded.extend(instances)

    # 4. Merge with exception instances (modified/deleted occurrences)
    exceptions = SELECT * FROM events WHERE recurrence_id IN (recurring_ids)
    # Apply exceptions: replace matching instances, remove cancelled ones

    return simple + expanded
\`\`\`

**Performance**:
- RRULE expansion is pure computation (no I/O): ~1ms for 1 year of weekly events
- Only expand within the requested time range (not all time)
- Exception instances are few (most recurring instances are unmodified)`
      },
      {
        question: 'How does the "Find a Time" scheduling feature work?',
        answer: `**Algorithm: Interval Gap Finding**:

**Input**:
- Participants: [Alice, Bob, Charlie, Room A]
- Duration: 30 minutes
- Range: next 2 weeks, working hours only (9am-5pm in each person's timezone)

**Step 1 - Gather Busy Intervals**:
\`\`\`
Alice:   [9:00-10:00, 11:00-12:00, 14:00-15:30]  (day 1, converted to UTC)
Bob:     [9:30-10:30, 13:00-14:00]
Charlie: [10:00-11:30, 15:00-16:00]
Room A:  [9:00-10:00, 14:00-16:00]
\`\`\`

**Step 2 - Merge All Busy Intervals** (union):
\`\`\`
Merged busy: [9:00-10:30, 10:00-12:00, 13:00-16:00]
Simplified:  [9:00-12:00, 13:00-16:00]
\`\`\`

**Step 3 - Find Gaps >= Duration**:
\`\`\`
Free slots: [12:00-13:00 (60min), 16:00-17:00 (60min)]
Both fit a 30-minute meeting!
\`\`\`

**Step 4 - Rank Suggestions**:
- Prefer earlier slots (less likely to conflict with new events)
- Prefer slots during "preferred" hours (10am-12pm, 2pm-4pm)
- Penalize slots that require timezone inconvenience (2am for someone)
- Score each slot, return top 3-5 suggestions

**Implementation Optimization**:
- Read from materialized free/busy blocks (not raw events)
- Index: (user_id, start_time) enables efficient range scan
- For N participants, 2-week range: ~100-500 busy blocks to merge
- Merge algorithm: O(N log N) sort + linear scan = <10ms

**Working Hours Per Timezone**:
- Each participant has a timezone and working hours preference
- Convert working hours to UTC ranges for each day in the range
- Non-working hours are treated as "busy" in the merge step`
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you handle time zones correctly?',
        answer: `**The Problem**:
- Alice creates "Meeting at 3pm ET" on March 5
- Bob views it in PT: should see 12pm
- On March 10 (after DST spring-forward): ET is now EDT, PT is now PDT
- The meeting should STILL be at 3pm ET / 12pm PT (not shift by an hour)

**Correct Storage Strategy**:
\`\`\`
DON'T store: start_time = "2024-03-05T15:00:00-05:00" (offset)
            (offset changes with DST, this is ambiguous for recurring events)

DO store:   start_time = "2024-03-05T20:00:00Z" (UTC)
            timezone = "America/New_York"
\`\`\`

**Why UTC + Timezone Name (not Offset)?**:
- Offset -05:00 could be EST or CDT (ambiguous)
- Timezone name "America/New_York" encodes all DST transition rules
- For recurring events: "every Tuesday at 3pm America/New_York" correctly adjusts for DST

**Recurring Event Expansion with DST**:
\`\`\`
Rule: FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=TU at 15:00 America/New_York

Before DST (EST, UTC-5):  Tuesday 15:00 EST = 20:00 UTC
After DST (EDT, UTC-4):   Tuesday 15:00 EDT = 19:00 UTC

The UTC value changes! But the local time (3pm ET) stays the same.
\`\`\`

**IANA Timezone Database**:
- Use the IANA tz database (e.g., via date-fns-tz or Java's ZoneId)
- Updated regularly with new DST rules (countries change their DST policies)
- Server must use the latest tz database version
- Edge case: a country abolishes DST -> all future recurring events need recomputation`

    introduction: `Online chess platforms like Chess.com and Lichess serve millions of games per day, combining real-time interactive gameplay with sophisticated matchmaking and rating systems. The system must handle the unique characteristics of turn-based games: strict move validation, multiple time control formats (bullet, blitz, rapid, classical), and real-time clock synchronization between players.

Unlike many real-time systems where eventual consistency is acceptable, chess requires strict consistency: both players must always see the same board state, and clock times must be accurate to the tenth of a second (in bullet chess, a tenth of a second can determine the winner). The server is the authoritative source of truth for both the board and the clocks.

The matchmaking system is also interesting: it must pair players of similar rating with minimal wait time, handle multiple game variants (standard, chess960, crazyhouse), and prevent rating manipulation while maintaining statistical accuracy (the Glicko-2 rating system).`,

**Latency Compensation**:
- On game start: server pings both clients, estimates round-trip time (RTT)
- Estimated one-way latency = RTT / 2
- Time used = time on server - estimated one-way latency
- This ensures a player with 200ms latency isn't penalized 200ms per move vs a player with 20ms

**Pre-move / Pre-claim**:
- Player can set a "pre-move" (queued move before opponent's turn)
- When opponent's move arrives, pre-move is executed with near-zero think time
- Critical for bullet chess where reaction time matters

**Clock Sync Messages**:
- Server sends clock state with every move
- If client clock drifts (due to browser tab throttling), server clock is authoritative
- Client interpolates between server updates for smooth display

**Timeout Detection**:
- Server runs a timer for the active player
- If clock reaches 0: game ends (timeout)
- Grace period: 100ms (accounts for in-flight move from client)`

        question: 'How does the matchmaking system work?',
        answer: `**Rating-Bucketed Pool with Time-Based Widening**:

**Pool Structure** (Redis sorted sets):
\`\`\`
seek:blitz:3+2:rated -> Sorted set (score = rating)
  { player: "alice", rating: 1500, seekTime: T }
  { player: "bob", rating: 1520, seekTime: T-5 }
  { player: "charlie", rating: 1800, seekTime: T-15 }
\`\`\`

**Matching Algorithm**:
\`\`\`python
def find_match(seeker):
    pool_key = f"seek:{seeker.time_control}:{seeker.variant}:{'rated' if seeker.rated else 'casual'}"

    # Start with tight rating range, widen over time
    wait_time = now() - seeker.created_at
    rating_range = 50 + (wait_time_seconds * 10)  # widens 10 points/sec
    rating_range = min(rating_range, 500)  # cap at ±500

    # Find candidates within rating range
    candidates = ZRANGEBYSCORE pool_key
                   seeker.rating - rating_range,
                   seeker.rating + rating_range

    if candidates:
        # Pick closest rating match
        best = min(candidates, key=lambda c: abs(c.rating - seeker.rating))
        # Atomically remove both from pool, create game
        ZREM pool_key seeker, best
        create_game(seeker, best)
    else:
        # No match yet, stay in pool
        return None  # check again in 1 second
\`\`\`

**Fairness**:
- Rating range starts narrow (±50): strong preference for close matches
- Widens over time: after 30 seconds, range is ±350 (accept wider gap)
- Prevents indefinite waiting while maintaining quality matches

**Preventing Abuse**:
- Can't seek if already in a game
- Minimum time between seeks (prevent rapid cancel/re-seek for rating sniping)
- Provisional players (< 20 games) matched separately to protect established ratings

**Color Assignment**:
- Track each player's recent color history
- Assign to balance: if Alice played white 3 of last 4 games, she gets black
- If both have balanced history: random`

        question: 'How does the Glicko-2 rating system work?',
        answer: `**Why Not Simple Elo?**:
- Elo assumes all players are equally "certain" in their rating
- A player who played 1000 games has a very certain rating
- A new player or one returning after 6 months has an uncertain rating
- Glicko-2 tracks this uncertainty explicitly

**Three Components**:
- **Rating (r)**: skill level (like Elo), default 1500
- **Rating Deviation (RD)**: uncertainty in the rating (high = uncertain)
- **Volatility (σ)**: how much the player's skill fluctuates over time

**How It Works**:
\`\`\`
New player: r=1500, RD=350 (very uncertain)
After 20 games: r=1650, RD=75 (fairly certain)
After 6 months inactive: RD increases back toward 350 (uncertainty grows)
\`\`\`

**Rating Update After a Game**:
1. Expected score: E = 1 / (1 + 10^((opponent_r - my_r) / (400 * g(opponent_RD))))
   - g(RD) is a function that reduces weight of opponents with high RD
2. If I win against a higher-rated opponent: big rating gain
3. If I win against a lower-rated opponent with high RD: smaller gain (uncertain opponent)
4. RD decreases after each game (more certainty)
5. Volatility updated based on how surprising the result was

**Practical Effects**:
- **New player**: wins/losses cause large rating swings (high RD)
- **Established player**: ratings change slowly (low RD)
- **Returning player**: first few games cause larger swings (RD increased during inactivity)
- **Matchmaking uses RD**: prefer opponents with low RD (their rating is more reliable)

**Batch vs. Real-Time**:
- Original Glicko-2: batch update after a "rating period" (e.g., 1 week of games)
- Online adaptation: update after each game, but cap RD decrease per game
- This provides near-real-time rating updates while maintaining statistical properties`

    introduction: `Recommendation engines are the invisible backbone of every major content platform. Whether it is Netflix suggesting your next binge, YouTube autoplaying the perfect video, or Spotify creating Discover Weekly, the underlying system must sift through millions of items and billions of user signals to surface a personalized ranked list in under 200 milliseconds.

The core challenge is balancing three competing concerns: relevance (show the user things they will love), diversity (avoid filter bubbles and repetitive suggestions), and freshness (surface new content before it has engagement signals). The system must handle the cold-start problem for new users and new items, the popularity bias that drowns out niche content, and the real-time feedback loop where a single click changes the next set of recommendations.

From an infrastructure perspective, the system must serve recommendations at massive scale (millions of QPS), retrain models on petabytes of interaction data, and maintain low-latency feature stores that bridge the offline training world with the online serving world.`,

    keyQuestions: [
      {
        question: 'How does collaborative filtering work at scale?',
        answer: `**Core Idea**: Users who interacted with similar items have similar preferences.

**Matrix Factorization Approach**:
- Build a user-item interaction matrix (sparse: most entries are missing)
- Factorize into two lower-rank matrices: User matrix (N x k) and Item matrix (M x k)
- Each user and item is represented as a k-dimensional vector (embedding)
- Predicted score = dot product of user and item vectors

**Training** (Alternating Least Squares or SGD):
\`\`\`
For each known interaction (user_i, item_j, rating):
  Minimize: (rating - dot(user_vec_i, item_vec_j))^2 + regularization
\`\`\`

**Scaling to Billions of Interactions**:
- **Distributed training**: Spark MLlib or parameter server architecture
- Partition the interaction matrix by user shards
- Each worker processes its shard, synchronizes embeddings periodically
- Training on 100B interactions takes ~4 hours on a 100-node Spark cluster

**Serving** (Approximate Nearest Neighbor):
- Once trained, each user has a fixed embedding vector
- To get recommendations: find the top-K item vectors nearest to the user vector
- Use ANN index (HNSW, IVF) for sub-millisecond retrieval from millions of items
- Libraries: Faiss (Facebook), ScaNN (Google), Milvus (open source)

**Implicit Feedback** (more realistic than explicit ratings):
- Weighted by engagement: watch_completion > click > impression
- One-class problem: we observe positive signals but "no interaction" is ambiguous (not interested vs. never seen)
- Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR): optimize relative ordering of items per user`
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you handle the cold-start problem?',
        answer: `**Cold-Start Users** (no interaction history):

**Onboarding Signals**:
- Explicit preferences during signup (genre picks, favorite creators)
- Demographic features: age bucket, country, language -> demographic cohort recommendations
- Device/platform signals: iOS vs. Android, time zone

**Bandit-Based Exploration**:
- Treat new user's first N sessions as exploration
- Thompson Sampling: show items from diverse categories, observe reactions
- Each interaction rapidly narrows the user's preference estimate
- Transition to full personalization after ~20-30 interactions

**Cold-Start Items** (no engagement data):

**Content-Based Bootstrapping**:
- Extract content features: visual (CNN), audio (spectrogram), text (BERT embeddings)
- Find nearest existing items by content similarity
- "Borrow" engagement predictions from similar items
- Boost exposure in candidate generation to accumulate real signals

**Exploration Budget**:
- Reserve 5-10% of recommendation slots for cold-start items
- Distribute new items across diverse user segments to gather broad signal
- Use contextual bandits: show new item to users most likely to engage (based on content match)

**Measuring Cold-Start Performance**:
- Track "time to first meaningful engagement" for new users
- Track "impressions needed to reach stable CTR prediction" for new items
- Target: new users get personalized recommendations within 5 interactions; new items get stable predictions within 1000 impressions`
      },
      {
        question: 'How does the real-time feature pipeline work?',
        answer: `**Why Real-Time Matters**:
- User watches a cooking video -> next recommendations should reflect this immediately
- Without real-time: user sees stale recommendations until next batch retrain (hours later)
- Goal: user actions reflected in recommendations within 1-5 minutes

**Architecture**:
\`\`\`
User action -> API -> Kafka (interaction events)
                         |
                    Flink jobs (stream processing)
                         |
                    Feature Store (Redis)
                         |
                    Recommendation Service reads updated features
\`\`\`

**Feature Types by Freshness**:
- **Real-time (< 1 min)**: session features (last 10 items viewed, current category distribution), active device
- **Near-real-time (< 1 hour)**: user engagement rates updated with recent actions, trending scores
- **Batch (6-24 hours)**: user/item embeddings from full model retrain, long-term preference vectors

**Flink Processing Examples**:
\`\`\`
// Sliding window: user's genre distribution in last 30 minutes
SELECT user_id,
       genre,
       COUNT(*) as genre_count,
       AVG(watch_percentage) as avg_watch_pct
FROM interactions
WHERE timestamp > now() - INTERVAL 30 MINUTES
GROUP BY user_id, genre
\`\`\`

**Feature Store Design**:
- **Write path**: Flink outputs -> Redis (real-time features) + DynamoDB (durable backup)
- **Read path**: Recommendation service batch-fetches features for all candidates
  - Single round-trip via Redis MGET for user + candidate features
  - Latency budget: 10-20ms for feature retrieval
- **Fallback**: if real-time features are unavailable, use last-known batch features (slightly stale but always available)

**Consistency**:
- Features are eventually consistent (acceptable for recommendations)
- Version each feature update to prevent out-of-order writes
- Monitor feature freshness: alert if any feature type lags beyond its SLA`

Unlike traditional web services where request processing takes milliseconds, a single LLM inference request can take 10-60 seconds, consume gigabytes of GPU memory, and generate output token-by-token in an autoregressive loop.

The system must manage GPU clusters worth hundreds of millions of dollars, balance request queues across heterogeneous hardware (A100, H100, different memory configurations), and implement sophisticated inference optimizations (KV-cache management, continuous batching, speculative decoding) to maximize throughput while maintaining acceptable latency.

Beyond raw inference, the platform must handle conversation history (multi-turn context windows), streaming token delivery to clients, content safety filtering, rate limiting per user and organization, and graceful degradation when demand exceeds capacity. The cost of GPU compute makes efficiency not just a performance concern but an existential business requirement.`,

    ],

    keyQuestions: [
      {
        question: 'How does continuous batching work?',
        answer: `**Problem with Static Batching**:
- Collect N requests, process as a batch, wait for ALL to finish
- Short requests (20 tokens) wait for long requests (2000 tokens) in the same batch
- GPU idle time while waiting for the batch to fill
- Throughput: ~5-10 requests/sec per GPU

**Continuous Batching (Iteration-Level Scheduling)**:
\`\`\`
Iteration 1: [Req_A(token 1), Req_B(token 1), Req_C(token 1)]
Iteration 2: [Req_A(token 2), Req_B(DONE), Req_C(token 2)]
             -> Req_B slot freed, Req_D joins immediately
Iteration 3: [Req_A(token 3), Req_D(token 1), Req_C(token 3)]
\`\`\`

**How It Works**:
1. Maintain a running batch of active requests
2. Each iteration: generate one token for each request in the batch
3. When any request completes (hits stop token or max_tokens):
   - Remove it from the batch
   - Immediately insert the next waiting request
4. New requests start generating within one iteration (~50ms)

**Benefits**:
- GPU never idles waiting for batch to fill
- Short requests complete quickly without being blocked by long ones
- Throughput: ~50-200 requests/sec per GPU (10-20x improvement)
- TTFT reduced because requests do not wait for a full batch

**Memory Management Challenge**:
- Each request in the batch needs KV-cache memory
- Batch size limited by total GPU memory available for KV-cache
- PagedAttention solves this by eliminating memory fragmentation

**Prefill vs. Decode Phases**:
- Prefill (processing input tokens): compute-bound, benefits from parallelism
- Decode (generating output tokens): memory-bandwidth-bound, one token at a time
- Advanced systems separate prefill and decode into different GPU pools`
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you manage KV-cache memory efficiently?',
        answer: `**The KV-Cache Problem**:
- For each token in the context, the model stores Key and Value tensors for every attention layer
- GPT-4 class model: ~1-2MB of KV-cache per token per request
- 4096 token context: ~4-8GB of KV-cache per request
- A single 80GB A100 can only hold 10-20 concurrent requests!

**Traditional Approach (Wasteful)**:
- Pre-allocate max_context_length of KV-cache per request
- If max is 8192 but actual context is 500 tokens: 94% of allocated memory is wasted
- Result: far fewer concurrent requests than GPU memory allows

**PagedAttention (vLLM)**:
\`\`\`
Physical GPU memory divided into fixed-size "pages" (e.g., 16 tokens each)

Request A (200 tokens): Pages [P1, P2, ..., P13] (allocated on demand)
Request B (50 tokens):  Pages [P14, P15, P16, P17]
Request C (300 tokens): Pages [P18, ..., P37]

As Request B generates more tokens:
  New pages allocated: P38, P39, ... (non-contiguous, that is fine!)

When Request A completes:
  Pages [P1-P13] freed immediately, available for new requests
\`\`\`

**Benefits**:
- Near-zero memory waste (only last page may have unused slots)
- 2-4x more concurrent requests compared to pre-allocation
- Pages can be shared across requests (prefix caching)

**Prefix Caching**:
- Many requests share the same system prompt (e.g., "You are a helpful assistant...")
- Compute KV-cache for the system prompt once, share pages across all requests
- For a 500-token system prompt: saves 500-1000MB of KV-cache per request
- Particularly valuable for function-calling prompts (large tool definitions)

**Eviction Policy** (when GPU memory is full):
- Priority queue: premium tier users kept in GPU memory, free tier swapped
- Swap KV-cache to CPU memory (10x slower but cheaper than recomputation)
- Last resort: preempt lowest-priority request, recompute from scratch later`
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you handle GPU cluster scheduling and routing?',
        answer: `**Cluster Topology**:
\`\`\`
GPU Cluster (thousands of GPUs):
  ├── Model Pool: GPT-4 (8x H100 per instance, tensor parallel)
  │     ├── Instance 1: [GPU 0-7] - 12 active requests
  │     ├── Instance 2: [GPU 8-15] - 8 active requests (has capacity)
  │     └── Instance 3: [GPU 16-23] - 15 active requests (at capacity)
  ├── Model Pool: GPT-3.5 (1x A100 per instance)
  │     ├── Instance 1-50: varying load
  │     └── ...
  └── Model Pool: Fine-tuned variants (mixed hardware)
\`\`\`

**Global Request Scheduler**:
1. Request arrives at API Gateway
2. Scheduler selects target instance based on:
   - **Model match**: route to instances running the requested model
   - **KV-cache affinity**: if this is a multi-turn conversation, route to the instance that has the KV-cache from the previous turn (avoid recomputation)
   - **Load balancing**: prefer instances with lower queue depth
   - **SLO tier**: premium users routed to less-loaded instances
   - **Memory availability**: check if instance has enough KV-cache memory for the request

**Autoscaling**:
- Scale based on queue depth and average TTFT, not just GPU utilization
- Scale-up is slow (loading model weights takes 2-5 minutes for large models)
- Keep warm spare capacity: always maintain 10-15% idle instances
- Predictive scaling: use historical traffic patterns (traffic doubles during US business hours)

**Handling Overload**:
- Priority queuing: premium requests skip ahead of free-tier
- Request shedding: reject lowest-priority requests with 429 status when queue exceeds threshold
- Graceful degradation: offer smaller/faster model as fallback ("GPT-4 is busy, GPT-3.5 available")
- Token budget management: limit max_tokens for free-tier during peak to increase throughput

**Fault Tolerance**:
- GPU failure detection via heartbeat (5-second timeout)
- Running requests on failed GPU: client receives error, retries on different instance
- KV-cache is ephemeral: loss means re-prefill (extra latency but not data loss)
- Model weight replication: weights stored in shared storage (S3), loaded on demand`

    description: 'Design a deployment system supporting blue-green, canary, and rolling deployments with CI/CD pipelines at scale.',

    introduction: `A deployment system is the bridge between source code and production. At scale, companies deploy thousands of times per day across hundreds of microservices, and a bad deployment can take down the entire platform. The system must provide both velocity (developers ship fast) and safety (bad code is caught before it reaches all users).

The core challenge is managing the lifecycle of a deployment: building the artifact (container image), running tests, gradually rolling out to production instances, monitoring health metrics, and automatically rolling back if something goes wrong. Each deployment strategy (blue-green, canary, rolling) offers different tradeoffs between speed, resource cost, and risk.

Beyond the mechanics of placing containers on servers, the system must handle dependency management (service A depends on service B version >= 2.0), configuration management (feature flags, environment variables), and observability integration (connecting deployment events to metrics dashboards for impact correlation).`,

        question: 'How does canary deployment with automated analysis work?',
        answer: `**Canary Deployment Flow**:
\`\`\`
1. Deploy canary (1 instance with new version alongside N baseline instances)
2. Route 1% of traffic to canary via service mesh weighted routing
3. Collect metrics for 5 minutes (error rate, p50/p99 latency, CPU, custom business metrics)
4. Canary Analysis Engine compares canary vs. baseline
5. If pass: promote to 5% -> 25% -> 50% -> 100% (with analysis at each stage)
6. If fail at any stage: automatic rollback to 0% canary traffic, terminate canary instances
\`\`\`

**Canary Analysis Engine**:
\`\`\`python
def analyze_canary(deployment_id, metric_name):
    canary_samples = get_metric_samples(deployment_id, "canary", metric_name, window="5m")
    baseline_samples = get_metric_samples(deployment_id, "baseline", metric_name, window="5m")

    # Mann-Whitney U test (non-parametric, no normality assumption)
    statistic, p_value = mannwhitneyu(canary_samples, baseline_samples, alternative='greater')

    if p_value < 0.05:  # canary is statistically worse
        return Verdict.FAIL
    elif len(canary_samples) < MIN_SAMPLE_SIZE:
        return Verdict.INCONCLUSIVE  # need more data, extend analysis window
    else:
        return Verdict.PASS
\`\`\`

**Metrics Compared**:
- **Error rate**: canary error rate should not be statistically higher than baseline
- **Latency (p50, p99)**: canary should not be slower
- **Resource usage**: CPU/memory should not spike (indicates potential leak or inefficiency)
- **Custom business metrics**: conversion rate, checkout success, etc.

**Traffic Splitting via Service Mesh**:
\`\`\`yaml
# Istio VirtualService
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: VirtualService
spec:
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: payment-service
        subset: stable
      weight: 95
    - destination:
        host: payment-service
        subset: canary
      weight: 5
\`\`\`

**Handling Edge Cases**:
- **Low traffic services**: extend analysis window (30 min instead of 5 min) or use synthetic load
- **Flaky metrics**: use rolling averages and require consecutive failures before rollback
- **Regional differences**: analyze canary independently per region, not globally aggregated`
      },
      {
        question: 'How does blue-green deployment achieve zero-downtime?',
        answer: `**Blue-Green Architecture**:
\`\`\`
Load Balancer / DNS
       |
  ┌────┴────┐
  ▼         ▼
 BLUE      GREEN
(v1.2)    (v1.3)   <- new version deployed here while blue handles traffic
 active    standby

After validation: switch traffic from BLUE -> GREEN
GREEN becomes active, BLUE becomes standby
\`\`\`

**Deployment Steps**:
1. **Prepare Green**: deploy new version to Green environment (identical to Blue in capacity)
2. **Validate Green**: run smoke tests, synthetic traffic, health checks against Green
3. **Switch Traffic**: update load balancer target group (ALB) or DNS record to point to Green
4. **Drain Blue**: wait for in-flight requests on Blue to complete (connection draining, 30-60 seconds)
5. **Monitor**: watch Green metrics for 15-30 minutes (bake time)
6. **Cleanup**: Blue can be kept warm for instant rollback or terminated to save cost

**Traffic Switch Methods**:
- **Load Balancer (instant)**: ALB target group swap, traffic shifts within seconds
- **DNS (slower)**: update DNS record, depends on TTL propagation (set TTL to 60s before switch)
- **Service Mesh (granular)**: weighted routing allows gradual blue->green shift

**Rollback** (the key advantage):
- Blue environment is still running (or can be restarted from same image)
- Switch traffic back: load balancer points to Blue again
- Rollback time: < 30 seconds (just a target group change)
- No need to rebuild, redeploy, or re-download anything

**Cost Tradeoff**:
- Requires 2x infrastructure during deployment (both Blue and Green running)
- Mitigation: keep standby environment at reduced capacity, scale up before switch
- For stateless services: auto-scaling handles this naturally
- For services with warm caches: pre-warm Green cache before traffic switch

**Database Considerations**:
- Blue-green is easy for stateless services but hard when database schema changes
- Strategy: make DB changes backward-compatible (additive only), deploy DB change first, then application
- Never drop columns or rename tables during blue-green: both versions must work with same schema`
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you handle rollback safely?',
        answer: `**Rollback Triggers** (automated):
1. Health check failures exceed threshold (3 consecutive failures)
2. Canary analysis verdict: FAIL on any critical metric
3. Error rate spike > 2x baseline within 2 minutes of promotion
4. Alerting system fires P1/P2 alert correlated with deployment window

**Rollback Triggers** (manual):
5. Engineer clicks "Rollback" button with reason
6. On-call engineer triggers via CLI: \`deploy rollback --service payment --reason "elevated 5xx"\`

**Rollback Mechanics by Strategy**:

**Blue-Green Rollback** (fastest: < 30 seconds):
- Switch load balancer back to old environment
- Old environment was never touched, still running previous version
- In-flight requests to new version may error (acceptable, clients retry)

**Canary Rollback** (fast: < 60 seconds):
- Set canary traffic weight to 0% in service mesh
- Terminate canary instances
- 100% traffic goes to stable baseline (which was always serving)
- Minimal user impact since canary was serving small % of traffic

**Rolling Update Rollback** (slower: 2-5 minutes):
- Some instances already running new version
- Reverse the rolling update: deploy old version back to updated instances
- During rollback, mixed versions are serving (both old and new)
- Requires backward-compatible versions to avoid issues during transition

**Safe Rollback Patterns**:
- **Deployment locks**: only one deployment per service at a time (prevents rollback-during-rollback)
- **Rollback version pinning**: always roll back to last-known-good, not just "previous" (which may also be bad)
- **Database migration rollback**: if the new version ran DB migrations, rollback code must handle both old and new schema
- **In-flight request handling**: connection draining ensures requests complete before instance termination

**Post-Rollback**:
- Auto-create incident ticket with deployment context
- Capture canary metrics snapshot for debugging
- Lock service from re-deployment until incident is resolved
- Notify team channel with rollback details and link to metrics dashboard`

    introduction: `Distributed search is one of the foundational building blocks of modern infrastructure. Whether powering a site search for an e-commerce platform, log analytics for a DevOps team, or full-text search across a social network, the underlying system must ingest documents, build inverted indices, and serve queries with sub-second latency across billions of documents.

The core data structure is the inverted index: a mapping from every unique term to the list of documents containing that term. Building, updating, and querying this index in a distributed setting is where the complexity lies. Documents must be analyzed (tokenized, stemmed, normalized), indexed across shards for parallelism, and queries must be scattered to relevant shards then gathered and merged.

Beyond basic keyword matching, a production search system needs relevance ranking (BM25, TF-IDF), faceted aggregations, fuzzy matching, near-real-time indexing (documents searchable within seconds of ingestion), and the ability to scale horizontally as data grows from gigabytes to petabytes.`,

        answer: `**Inverted Index Structure**:
\`\`\`
Document 1: "the quick brown fox"
Document 2: "the lazy brown dog"
Document 3: "quick fox jumps"

Inverted Index:
  "the"   -> [doc1(pos:0), doc2(pos:0)]
  "quick" -> [doc1(pos:1), doc3(pos:0)]
  "brown" -> [doc1(pos:2), doc2(pos:2)]
  "fox"   -> [doc1(pos:3), doc3(pos:1)]
  "lazy"  -> [doc2(pos:1)]
  "dog"   -> [doc2(pos:3)]
  "jumps" -> [doc3(pos:2)]
\`\`\`

**Query Execution: "quick brown"**:
1. Look up "quick" -> posting list [doc1, doc3]
2. Look up "brown" -> posting list [doc1, doc2]
3. For OR query: union -> [doc1, doc2, doc3]
4. For AND query: intersection -> [doc1]
5. Score each result using BM25

**BM25 Scoring**:
\`\`\`
score(doc, query) = Σ for each term t in query:
  IDF(t) * (tf(t,doc) * (k1 + 1)) / (tf(t,doc) + k1 * (1 - b + b * fieldLen/avgFieldLen))

Where:
  IDF(t) = log((N - df(t) + 0.5) / (df(t) + 0.5) + 1)
  tf(t,doc) = term frequency in document
  N = total documents, df(t) = documents containing term
  k1 = 1.2 (term frequency saturation), b = 0.75 (field length normalization)
\`\`\`

**Distributed Query (Scatter-Gather)**:
1. Coordinating node receives query
2. Sends query to one copy of each shard (primary or replica)
3. Each shard executes locally: look up posting lists, score, return top-K
4. Coordinating node merges sorted results from all shards
5. Fetch full documents (_source) for the final top-N results

**Optimization**:
- Skip lists in posting lists for fast intersection
- Block-Max WAND algorithm: skips low-scoring documents early
- Query rewriting: "quick brown" as phrase query requires position matching`
      },
      {
        question: 'How does near-real-time indexing work?',
        answer: `**The Segment Model** (inspired by Lucene):

**Write Path**:
\`\`\`
1. Document arrives at primary shard
2. Written to translog (WAL) for durability
3. Added to in-memory buffer (indexing buffer)
4. Response returned to client (document NOT yet searchable)

Every 1 second (refresh interval):
5. In-memory buffer flushed to a new segment (immutable, on disk)
6. New segment is opened for searching
7. Document is now searchable! (this is the "near-real-time" part)

Periodically (every 30 minutes or when translog is large):
8. Full flush: all in-memory data written to segments
9. Translog is cleared (segments are now the durable copy)
\`\`\`

**What Is a Segment?**:
- An immutable, self-contained inverted index
- Once written, never modified (append-only architecture)
- Each segment has its own: inverted index, document store, field norms, deletion bitset
- A shard = collection of segments + in-memory buffer

**Why Immutability?**:
- No locking needed for reads (segments never change)
- Concurrent reads and writes without contention
- Crash recovery: replay translog to reconstruct in-memory buffer

**Segment Merging** (background process):
\`\`\`
Before: [seg1: 100 docs] [seg2: 100 docs] [seg3: 50 docs] [seg4: 200 docs] [seg5: 80 docs]
After merge: [seg1_2_3: 250 docs] [seg4_5: 280 docs]
\`\`\`
- Merge combines small segments into larger ones
- Deleted documents are purged during merge (previously just marked in bitset)
- Reduces number of segments that need to be searched per query
- Tiered merge policy: small segments merge frequently, large segments merge rarely

**Tuning Trade-offs**:
- Lower refresh interval (100ms) = faster searchability but more small segments = slower queries
- Higher refresh interval (30s) = better indexing throughput but longer delay to searchability
- For bulk loading: disable refresh, index all data, then refresh once`
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you handle distributed scoring and relevance?',
        answer: `**The Problem with Distributed BM25**:
- BM25 needs global statistics: total document count (N), document frequency (df) per term
- Each shard only knows its local statistics
- Shard 1 has 1M docs, shard 2 has 1M docs: each thinks N=1M but true N=2M
- If term "rare_word" appears in 100 docs on shard 1 and 0 docs on shard 2:
  - Shard 1 IDF: calculated with df=100 (correct locally)
  - Shard 2 IDF: term not found locally, very high IDF if document is somehow present
  - Scores are inconsistent across shards!

**Solution 1: DFS_QUERY_THEN_FETCH** (Elasticsearch approach):
\`\`\`
Phase 1 (Distributed Frequency Scatter):
  - Coordinating node sends query to all shards
  - Each shard returns local statistics: {term: df, total_docs: N}
  - Coordinating node aggregates into global statistics

Phase 2 (Query with Global Stats):
  - Coordinating node sends query + global stats to all shards
  - Each shard scores using global stats -> consistent scores
  - Returns top-K doc IDs + scores

Phase 3 (Fetch):
  - Coordinating node determines final top-N across all shards
  - Fetches full documents from relevant shards
\`\`\`

**Solution 2: Shard-Local Scoring (default, good enough)**:
- With enough documents per shard (~10K+), local statistics approximate global
- Law of large numbers: term distributions converge across shards
- Much faster (2 phases vs. 3), acceptable for most use cases

**When Local Scoring Fails**:
- Very small indices (< 1000 docs per shard)
- Highly skewed data distribution (one shard has all docs of a certain type)
- Precise ranking is critical (e-commerce product search)

**Advanced Ranking**:
- **Learning to Rank (LTR)**: train ML model to predict relevance, use BM25 as one feature among many
- **Personalized ranking**: boost results based on user history (requires user context in query)
- **Freshness boost**: multiply score by recency factor for time-sensitive searches
- **Function scoring**: combine BM25 with custom scoring functions (popularity, location proximity)`

    introduction: `Object storage (blob storage) is the foundational storage layer of the cloud. Amazon S3 alone stores over 350 trillion objects, and virtually every modern application depends on some form of blob storage for images, videos, backups, logs, and data lake storage. Designing such a system requires solving some of the hardest problems in distributed systems: achieving 99.999999999% (11-nines) durability, scaling to exabytes of data, and maintaining strong read-after-write consistency.

Unlike file systems that use hierarchical directories and support in-place modifications, object storage uses a flat namespace (bucket + key) and treats objects as immutable blobs. This simplification enables massive horizontal scaling: objects can be distributed across thousands of storage nodes without complex locking or directory traversal.

The core challenges include: efficiently chunking and distributing large objects across nodes, implementing erasure coding for durability without 3x storage overhead, maintaining a metadata layer that can handle trillions of keys with low-latency lookups, and providing strong consistency guarantees in a geo-distributed setting.`,

      {
        question: 'How does erasure coding achieve 11-nines durability?',
        answer: `**Erasure Coding Basics (Reed-Solomon)**:
- Split data into k data fragments, generate m parity fragments
- Can tolerate loss of any m fragments (out of k+m total)
- Storage overhead: (k+m)/k instead of replication's 3x

**Example: 8+3 Reed-Solomon**:
\`\`\`
64MB chunk -> split into 8 x 8MB data fragments
           -> generate 3 x 8MB parity fragments
           -> 11 fragments total, stored on 11 different nodes
           -> can lose ANY 3 nodes and still reconstruct the chunk
           -> storage overhead: 11/8 = 1.375x (vs. 3x for replication)
\`\`\`

**Durability Calculation**:
- Assume annual node failure rate: 2% (industry average for disks)
- For data loss, need 4+ simultaneous failures among 11 fragments (before repair)
- Repair time: detect failure + reconstruct from remaining 8 fragments: ~2 hours
- P(4 failures in 2 hours among 11 nodes) ≈ 10^-11 per chunk per year
- This gives 99.999999999% (11-nines) durability per chunk

**Why Not Just Use 3x Replication?**:
- 3 copies: lose data if 3 specific nodes fail simultaneously
- P(3 failures in repair window among 3 nodes) ≈ 10^-6 per year (only 6-nines)
- To match 11-nines with replication: need 5-6 copies (5-6x overhead)
- Erasure coding achieves better durability with less storage

**Background Integrity Verification (Scrubbing)**:
\`\`\`
Every 30 days for each chunk:
1. Read all 11 fragments
2. Verify SHA-256 checksum of each fragment
3. If any fragment is corrupted or missing:
   a. Reconstruct from remaining healthy fragments
   b. Write repaired fragment to a new healthy node
   c. Update chunk_placement metadata
4. Report: chunks_scrubbed, fragments_repaired, data_at_risk
\`\`\`

**Protection Against Correlated Failures**:
- Place fragments across different racks, power domains, and availability zones
- Rack-aware placement: no 2 fragments of the same chunk on the same rack
- AZ-aware: distribute across 3 AZs (4+4+3 fragments) for zone-level resilience`
      },
      {
        question: 'How does the metadata layer work at trillion-object scale?',
        answer: `**The Challenge**:
- Trillions of objects = trillions of key-value entries
- Each GET needs a metadata lookup: must be fast (< 10ms)
- LIST operations need range scans by prefix: requires ordered storage
- Strong consistency for PUT (read-after-write): requires consensus

**Architecture: Sharded Raft KV Store**:
\`\`\`
Metadata Cluster:
  Shard 1 (Raft group: 3 nodes): keys with hash 0-999
  Shard 2 (Raft group: 3 nodes): keys with hash 1000-1999
  ...
  Shard N (Raft group: 3 nodes): keys with hash (N-1)*1000 - N*1000-1

Each shard stores:
  - Object metadata: bucket+key -> {size, etag, chunk_manifest, ...}
  - Backed by RocksDB (LSM-tree) for sorted key storage
\`\`\`

**Key Operations**:

**PUT metadata** (on object upload completion):
1. Route to correct shard by hash(bucket, key)
2. Raft leader writes to local RocksDB + replicates to 2 followers
3. Acknowledged after majority (2/3) confirm
4. Guarantees read-after-write consistency

**GET metadata** (on object read):
1. Route to correct shard by hash(bucket, key)
2. Read from Raft leader (for strong consistency) or any replica (for eventual)
3. Return object metadata including chunk manifest

**LIST by prefix** (the hard part):
- Hash-based sharding destroys key ordering!
- Solution: maintain a secondary prefix index
  - Separate shard groups ordered by (bucket, key_prefix)
  - Updated asynchronously on PUT/DELETE
  - LIST reads from prefix-ordered shards (range scan)
  - Slightly eventual (new objects may take 1-2 seconds to appear in LIST)
  - This is why S3 had eventual consistency for LIST even after adding strong consistency for GET

**Scaling**:
- Each shard handles ~1M keys
- 1T objects = 1M shards
- Shards automatically split when they exceed size threshold
- Shard rebalancing: migrate shard replicas to new nodes as cluster grows`

- Single PUT has a practical limit (~5GB): network timeouts, no resume on failure
- A 1TB object would take hours on a single connection
- Multipart enables: parallel upload, resumable upload, and streaming

**Multipart Upload Flow**:
\`\`\`
Step 1: Initiate
  POST /bucket/key?uploads -> { uploadId: "abc123" }
  Server creates upload session in metadata store

Step 2: Upload Parts (parallel)
  PUT /bucket/key?partNumber=1&uploadId=abc123  Body: [64MB chunk]  -> { ETag: "aaa" }
  PUT /bucket/key?partNumber=2&uploadId=abc123  Body: [64MB chunk]  -> { ETag: "bbb" }
  PUT /bucket/key?partNumber=3&uploadId=abc123  Body: [64MB chunk]  -> { ETag: "ccc" }
  ... (parts can be uploaded in any order, from multiple clients)

  Each part:
  1. Written to storage nodes with erasure coding (just like a regular small object)
  2. Part metadata stored: {uploadId, partNumber, size, etag, chunk_ids}
  3. Acknowledged independently

Step 3: Complete
  POST /bucket/key?uploadId=abc123
  Body: { parts: [{1, "aaa"}, {2, "bbb"}, {3, "ccc"}] }

  Server:
  1. Verifies all parts exist and ETags match
  2. Assembles chunk manifest: ordered list of all chunks from all parts
  3. Writes final object metadata atomically
  4. Object is now readable as a single entity
  5. Cleans up upload session state

Step 4 (optional): Abort
  DELETE /bucket/key?uploadId=abc123
  Server: marks all uploaded parts for garbage collection
\`\`\`

**Parallel Upload Optimization**:
\`\`\`
Client with 1Gbps connection uploading 1TB file:
  Sequential: 1TB / 125MB/s = ~2.2 hours
  Parallel (8 connections): 1TB / (125MB/s * 8) = ~17 minutes
  Parallel (32 connections): 1TB / (125MB/s * 32) = ~4 minutes
\`\`\`

**Failure Handling**:
- Part upload fails: retry just that part (other parts already stored)
- Client crash: incomplete upload persists, cleaned up after configurable timeout (7 days default)
- Network issue: client can resume by re-uploading only missing part numbers
- Server crash: parts stored on durable storage nodes survive; session metadata replicated via Raft

**Deduplication** (optional, storage optimization):
- Compute content hash (SHA-256) per chunk
- Before storing: check if chunk with same hash already exists
- If yes: reference existing chunk (copy-on-write metadata update)
- Saves storage for backup workloads where many versions of similar files exist`

    description: 'Design a distributed task scheduling system with job queuing, priority management, retry logic, and dead letter queues.',

    introduction: `Distributed task schedulers are the workhorses behind every large-scale application. From sending millions of push notifications, to processing image thumbnails, to running daily ETL pipelines, virtually every operation that does not need to happen synchronously in a request path is handled by a task scheduling system.

The fundamental challenge is reliable execution: ensuring that every submitted task is eventually executed exactly once, even in the face of worker crashes, network partitions, and queue backlogs. This "exactly-once" guarantee is deceptively difficult in a distributed setting, and the system must handle subtle failure modes like a worker that processes a task but crashes before acknowledging completion.

Beyond reliability, the system must support priorities (high-priority tasks skip ahead of low-priority), scheduling (run at a specific time or on a cron schedule), task dependencies (task B runs only after task A succeeds), rate limiting (do not overwhelm downstream APIs), and observability (where is my task, why is it stuck, how long will it take?).`,

        question: 'How do you achieve exactly-once task execution?',
        answer: `**The Reality: At-Least-Once + Idempotency = Exactly-Once Semantics**

True exactly-once in a distributed system is impossible (FLP impossibility). What we achieve:
- **At-least-once delivery**: guaranteed by the queue + retry mechanism
- **Exactly-once processing**: guaranteed by making task handlers idempotent

**At-Least-Once Delivery via Visibility Timeout**:
\`\`\`
1. Worker pulls task from queue
2. Task becomes "invisible" to other workers for 60 seconds (visibility timeout)
3. Worker processes task:
   a. Success: worker sends ACK, task permanently removed from queue
   b. Worker crashes: no ACK, visibility timeout expires after 60s
   c. Task reappears in queue, another worker picks it up
4. Worker taking too long: heartbeat extends visibility timeout before it expires
\`\`\`

**Problem: Duplicate Execution**:
\`\`\`
Worker A picks task, processes it, sends ACK
ACK is lost due to network issue
Visibility timeout expires -> task reappears
Worker B picks the same task -> processes it AGAIN
\`\`\`

**Solution: Idempotency Key + Deduplication Store**:
\`\`\`python
def process_task(task):
    dedup_key = f"task:{task.idempotency_key}"

    # Check if already processed (Redis SET NX with TTL)
    if redis.set(dedup_key, "processing", nx=True, ex=86400):
        # First time: process the task
        result = execute_task_logic(task)
        redis.set(dedup_key, json.dumps(result), ex=86400)
        return result
    else:
        # Already processed: return cached result
        return json.loads(redis.get(dedup_key))
\`\`\`

**Making Task Handlers Idempotent**:
- **Sending email**: check if email already sent for this event (dedup by event_id)
- **Charging payment**: use Stripe's idempotency_key parameter
- **Updating database**: use upsert (INSERT ON CONFLICT UPDATE) instead of blind INSERT
- **Generating thumbnail**: check if output already exists in storage before processing

**Idempotency Key Generation**:
- Must be deterministic for the same logical task
- Example: \`send_email:{userId}:{eventType}:{eventId}\`
- Caller provides it at submission time (not auto-generated UUID)`

        question: 'How does the retry mechanism with dead letter queues work?',
        answer: `**Retry Policy Configuration**:
\`\`\`json
{
  "maxRetries": 5,
  "initialBackoffMs": 1000,
  "backoffMultiplier": 2,
  "maxBackoffMs": 60000,
  "jitterPercent": 25,
  "retryableErrors": ["TIMEOUT", "SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE", "RATE_LIMITED"],
  "nonRetryableErrors": ["INVALID_INPUT", "UNAUTHORIZED"]
}
\`\`\`

**Retry Flow**:
\`\`\`
Attempt 1: execute task
  -> fails with TIMEOUT
  -> delay = 1000ms + random(0, 250ms) = ~1.1s
  -> requeue with scheduled_at = now + 1.1s

Attempt 2: execute task (after 1.1s delay)
  -> fails with SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE
  -> delay = 2000ms + random(0, 500ms) = ~2.3s
  -> requeue with scheduled_at = now + 2.3s

Attempt 3: execute task (after 2.3s delay)
  -> fails with TIMEOUT
  -> delay = 4000ms + random(0, 1000ms) = ~4.7s
  -> requeue with scheduled_at = now + 4.7s

...

Attempt 5: execute task
  -> fails with TIMEOUT
  -> max retries exhausted -> move to Dead Letter Queue
\`\`\`

**Why Jitter?**:
- Without jitter: if 1000 tasks fail at the same time, all retry at the same time -> thundering herd
- With 25% jitter: retries spread across a time window, reducing downstream load spike

**Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**:
\`\`\`python
def handle_task_failure(task, error):
    task.attempt_count += 1

    if error.type in task.retry_policy.non_retryable_errors:
        move_to_dlq(task, error, reason="non_retryable_error")
        return

    if task.attempt_count >= task.retry_policy.max_retries:
        move_to_dlq(task, error, reason="max_retries_exhausted")
        return

    if task.deadline and now() > task.deadline:
        move_to_dlq(task, error, reason="deadline_exceeded")
        return

    # Calculate next retry delay
    delay = min(
        task.retry_policy.initial_backoff * (task.retry_policy.multiplier ** task.attempt_count),
        task.retry_policy.max_backoff
    )
    jitter = delay * random.uniform(0, task.retry_policy.jitter_percent / 100)
    task.scheduled_at = now() + delay + jitter
    requeue(task)
\`\`\`

**DLQ Management**:
- Dashboard shows all dead-lettered tasks with error history
- Operators can: inspect, retry individual tasks, retry all tasks of a type, purge
- Auto-alerting: if DLQ size exceeds threshold for a task type, page the owning team
- DLQ retention: 30 days, then archived to cold storage for compliance`
      },
      {
        question: 'How does priority scheduling prevent starvation?',
        answer: `**Strict Priority (Simple but Dangerous)**:
\`\`\`
Queue: CRITICAL -> HIGH -> NORMAL -> LOW
Worker always checks CRITICAL first, then HIGH, etc.

Problem: if CRITICAL queue always has tasks, NORMAL and LOW never execute
This is "starvation"
\`\`\`

**Weighted Fair Queuing (Better)**:
\`\`\`
Priority weights:
  CRITICAL: 50%
  HIGH:     30%
  NORMAL:   15%
  LOW:       5%

For every 100 tasks a worker processes:
  ~50 from CRITICAL
  ~30 from HIGH
  ~15 from NORMAL
  ~5 from LOW
\`\`\`

**Implementation with Weighted Random Selection**:
\`\`\`python
def pick_next_task(worker):
    # Check if any CRITICAL tasks exist (always priority)
    if critical_queue.size() > 0 and critical_queue.oldest_age() > MAX_WAIT:
        return critical_queue.dequeue()

    # Weighted random selection
    weights = {
        'critical': 50 * critical_queue.size_factor(),
        'high': 30 * high_queue.size_factor(),
        'normal': 15 * normal_queue.size_factor(),
        'low': 5 * low_queue.size_factor()
    }
    selected_queue = weighted_random_choice(weights)
    return selected_queue.dequeue()

def size_factor(queue):
    # Boost weight for queues that are backing up
    if queue.size() > queue.threshold:
        return min(queue.size() / queue.threshold, 3.0)  # cap at 3x
    return 1.0
\`\`\`

**Anti-Starvation Mechanisms**:
1. **Age-based promotion**: tasks waiting longer than threshold get promoted
   - NORMAL task waiting > 5 minutes -> promoted to HIGH
   - LOW task waiting > 15 minutes -> promoted to NORMAL
2. **Minimum guarantees**: reserve 5% of worker capacity for LOW priority
   - Even under heavy CRITICAL load, LOW tasks make progress
3. **Deadline awareness**: tasks with approaching deadlines get boosted regardless of priority

**Dynamic Priority Adjustment**:
\`\`\`
Scenario: payment processing tasks are NORMAL priority, but at month-end the queue backs up

Monitor detects:
  - payment_processing queue depth: 50K (threshold: 10K)
  - avg wait time: 45 minutes (SLA: 15 minutes)

Auto-adjustment:
  - Temporarily promote payment_processing to HIGH priority
  - Scale up worker pool for payment_processing type
  - Alert team: "payment_processing queue backed up, auto-promoted to HIGH"
  - Revert when queue depth drops below threshold
\`\`\`

**Worker Specialization**:
- Some workers only process specific task types (GPU workers for ML tasks)
- Generic workers handle all types with priority weighting
- Dedicated worker pools for CRITICAL tasks ensure they are never starved by volume of lower-priority work`
