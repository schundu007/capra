      introduction: `Amazon's 16 Leadership Principles (LPs) are the foundation of EVERY behavioral interview at Amazon. Expect 4-6 behavioral rounds where interviewers probe deeply into specific LPs. Each story you tell should clearly demonstrate one or more principles. Prepare 2-3 strong stories per principle.`,

      keyQuestions: [
        {
          question: 'Customer Obsession',
          answer: `**Definition**: Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust.

**What They Look For**:
- Decisions driven by customer needs, not internal convenience
- Going beyond requirements to delight customers
- Sacrificing short-term gains for long-term customer trust

**STAR Example**:

**Situation**: "A major client reported that our analytics dashboard was too slow for their workflow—taking 30 seconds to load."

**Task**: "The official roadmap had performance work scheduled for Q3, but the customer was frustrated now."

**Action**:
- "I spent a weekend profiling the specific queries they used most"
- "Found that 80% of their load time came from 3 expensive aggregations"
- "Implemented query result caching for these specific patterns"
- "Delivered a hotfix within 5 days—outside the normal sprint cycle"

**Result**: "Load time dropped from 30s to 2s for their use case. Customer renewed their enterprise contract. More importantly, I identified a pattern we could apply to other customers."

**Key Phrase**: "I always ask: what does the customer actually need, not what's easiest for us to build?"`
        },
        {
          question: 'Ownership',
          answer: `**Definition**: Leaders act on behalf of the entire company. They never say "that's not my job." They think long-term.

**What They Look For**:
- Taking responsibility beyond your immediate scope
- Not passing problems to others
- Long-term thinking over short-term convenience

**STAR Example**:

**Situation**: "I noticed our deployment pipeline was failing frequently, causing delays across multiple teams. Officially, it was the DevOps team's responsibility."

**Task**: "I could have just reported the issue, but our team was losing 2+ hours daily to failed deployments."

**Action**:
- "I spent evenings over two weeks diagnosing the root causes"
- "Found that 60% of failures were due to flaky integration tests, not infrastructure"
- "Proposed a fix: quarantine flaky tests while we improved them"
- "Created a dashboard showing deployment reliability trends"
- "Partnered with DevOps to implement the changes"

**Result**: "Deployment success rate improved from 65% to 95%. Other teams adopted the same patterns. I wasn't asked to do this—I saw a problem affecting many people and took ownership."

**Key Phrase**: "I never say 'that's not my job.' If I see a problem, I own it until it's solved."`
        },
        {
          question: 'Invent and Simplify',
          answer: `**Definition**: Leaders expect and require innovation from their teams. They find ways to simplify.

**What They Look For**:
- Creating new solutions, not just applying existing patterns
- Simplifying complex processes
- Being okay with being misunderstood (innovation is often controversial)

**STAR Example**:

**Situation**: "Our data pipeline had grown to 15 different services doing similar ETL work, each maintained by different teams with different approaches."

**Task**: "As we scaled, this complexity was causing reliability issues and slowing development."

**Action**:
- "I proposed a unified data processing framework that teams could configure rather than build custom pipelines"
- "Faced initial resistance—teams worried about losing flexibility"
- "Built a prototype demonstrating how 80% of use cases could be handled with configuration"
- "Created a migration guide and supported early adopters"

**Result**: "Consolidated 15 services into one framework with plugins for custom needs. Reduced pipeline failures by 70% and cut new pipeline setup time from 2 weeks to 2 days."

**Key Phrase**: "I look for complexity and ask: how can this be simpler?"`
        },
        {
          question: 'Dive Deep',
          answer: `**Definition**: Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, and audit frequently.

**What They Look For**:
- Not accepting surface-level explanations
- Digging into data and details personally
- Knowing when something doesn't add up

**STAR Example**:

**Situation**: "Our API latency metrics showed 50ms p50, which seemed great. But customers were complaining about slow responses."

**Task**: "Something wasn't adding up. I needed to find the real story."

**Action**:
- "Instead of trusting the dashboard, I traced actual customer requests end-to-end"
- "Discovered our metrics excluded network time and client-side processing"
- "Found that p99 latency was 3 seconds—hidden by the p50 metric"
- "Built new monitoring that captured full request lifecycle"
- "Identified specific slow endpoints and optimized them"

**Result**: "Customer-perceived latency dropped 80%. We caught a critical issue that our standard metrics had been hiding for months."

**Key Phrase**: "The details matter. When something doesn't feel right, I dig until I understand why."`
        },
        {
          question: 'Bias for Action',
          answer: `**Definition**: Speed matters. Many decisions are reversible and don't require extensive study.

**What They Look For**:
- Acting quickly with calculated risk
- Not waiting for perfect information
- Preferring action over analysis paralysis

**STAR Example**:

**Situation**: "At 10 PM on a Friday, we noticed a gradual increase in error rates. Nothing was broken yet, but the trend looked concerning."

**Task**: "We could wait to investigate Monday, or act now without full information."

**Action**:
- "I immediately set up enhanced monitoring to gather more data"
- "Made a quick judgment: the rate of increase suggested we'd hit critical levels by Sunday"
- "Identified the most likely cause (recent deployment) and proposed a rollback"
- "Made the call to rollback within 30 minutes, accepting I might be wrong"

**Result**: "The rollback stopped the error increase. Monday analysis confirmed a subtle bug in the deployment. If we'd waited, Saturday peak traffic would have caused an outage."

**Key Phrase**: "I'd rather make a fast decision and be wrong 20% of the time than wait for certainty and be right too late."`

      introduction: `Google evaluates candidates on four key dimensions: General Cognitive Ability, Role-Related Knowledge, Leadership, and "Googliness" (culture fit). Behavioral questions at Google focus less on specific frameworks and more on how you think, collaborate, and navigate ambiguity. Expect questions about complex technical decisions and working across teams.`,

      keyQuestions: [
        {
          question: 'Googliness (Culture Fit)',
          answer: `**What Google Looks For**:
- Comfort with ambiguity
- Collaborative problem-solving
- Intellectual humility—willing to be wrong
- Bringing out the best in others
- Doing the right thing even when it's hard

**Example Questions**:
- "Tell me about a time you disagreed with a decision and advocated for change"
- "Describe a time you helped someone else succeed"
- "How do you handle working with someone whose style is different from yours?"

**STAR Example**:

**Situation**: "A teammate was struggling with a high-visibility project. They hadn't asked for help, and stepping in uninvited could seem like I was taking over."

**Task**: "Help them succeed without undermining their ownership."

**Action**:
- "Started by asking questions to understand their challenges"
- "Offered to pair program on the hardest parts—framed as me learning, not them struggling"
- "Shared relevant resources and patterns from similar projects I'd worked on"
- "Made sure all credit went to them in team meetings"

**Result**: "They delivered successfully and on time. Later told me my help had been crucial. We became close collaborators, and I learned techniques from them too."

**Key Principle**: At Google, helping others succeed IS success.`
        },
        {
          question: 'General Cognitive Ability',
          answer: `**What Google Looks For**:
- Structured thinking and problem decomposition
- Learning on the fly
- Handling novel situations without precedent
- Meta-cognition—knowing what you don't know

**Example Questions**:
- "How would you improve [Google product]?"
- "Describe a time you had to learn something completely new"
- "Tell me about a complex problem you broke down into simpler parts"

**STAR Example**:

**Situation**: "I was asked to optimize a recommendation system but had no ML background."

**Task**: "Deliver meaningful improvements despite not being a domain expert."

**Action**:
- "Started by mapping what I didn't know vs. what I could figure out"
- "Read papers and talked to ML engineers to build intuition"
- "Focused on areas where my backend skills added value—data quality, feature engineering, serving infrastructure"
- "Proposed experiments I could validate without deep ML expertise"

**Result**: "My data quality improvements increased model accuracy by 15% before any ML changes. Proved that understanding the problem space matters as much as algorithmic expertise."

**Key Insight**: Google wants people who can figure things out, not people who already know everything.`
        },
        {
          question: 'Leadership',
          answer: `**What Google Looks For**:
- Emergent leadership—leading without authority
- Driving clarity in ambiguous situations
- Enabling team success over personal achievement
- Making hard calls when needed

**Example Questions**:
- "Tell me about leading a project without formal authority"
- "Describe a time you had to make an unpopular decision"
- "How do you handle a team that's not aligned?"

**STAR Example**:

**Situation**: "Our team of 8 had no clear direction. Different people were building features that overlapped or conflicted. Management was focused elsewhere."

**Task**: "Someone needed to bring clarity. I stepped up even though I was the most junior."

**Action**:
- "Created a shared document mapping everyone's work and identifying conflicts"
- "Facilitated a team discussion to align on priorities"
- "Proposed a simple coordination process: weekly sync + shared roadmap"
- "Volunteered to run the syncs and maintain the roadmap"

**Result**: "Team velocity improved 40% in the next quarter. Conflicts dropped to near-zero. I was promoted, but more importantly, the team functioned better."

**Key Principle**: At Google, you don't need a title to lead. Leadership is about creating clarity and enabling others.`

      principles: ['Move Fast', 'Be Bold', 'Focus on Impact', 'Be Open', 'Build Social Value'],

      introduction: `Meta's behavioral interviews focus on their core values: Move Fast, Be Bold, Focus on Impact, Be Open, and Build Social Value. They want builders who ship quickly, take big swings, and prioritize impact over perfection. Expect questions about moving fast, learning from failures, and making high-impact decisions.`,

      keyQuestions: [
        {
          question: 'Move Fast',
          answer: `**What Meta Looks For**:
- Speed of execution without sacrificing quality
- Iteration over perfection
- Removing blockers proactively
- Making decisions quickly

**STAR Example**:

**Situation**: "We needed to launch a new feature before a competitive product hit the market. Normal timeline was 3 months."

**Task**: "Deliver a high-quality launch in 6 weeks."

**Action**:
- "Ruthlessly scoped to minimum viable feature set"
- "Parallelized work across team members instead of sequential reviews"
- "Set up automated testing on day 1 to avoid manual QA bottlenecks"
- "Held daily 15-min syncs instead of weekly hour-long meetings"
- "Made decisions in real-time rather than waiting for consensus"

**Result**: "Launched in 5 weeks with positive user reception. Iterated based on feedback while competitors were still in development. Moving fast gave us first-mover advantage."

**Key Phrase**: "Done is better than perfect, as long as done means we can learn and iterate."`
        },
        {
          question: 'Focus on Impact',
          answer: `**What Meta Looks For**:
- Prioritizing high-leverage work
- Measuring and quantifying impact
- Killing low-impact work, even if you've already started
- Working on what matters, not just what's interesting

**STAR Example**:

**Situation**: "I was halfway through building a sophisticated analytics dashboard when I realized only 10% of users would actually use it."

**Task**: "Decide whether to finish what I'd started or pivot to something higher impact."

**Action**:
- "Analyzed user data to find where the real pain points were"
- "Discovered that a simple alert feature would help 80% of users"
- "Made the hard call to shelve my dashboard work"
- "Pitched the simpler feature and got quick approval"
- "Shipped the alert feature in 2 weeks"

**Result**: "Alert feature had 10x the engagement of my original dashboard plan. I learned that impact isn't about complexity—it's about solving real problems for real users."

**Key Phrase**: "I constantly ask: is this the highest-impact thing I could be doing right now?"`
        },
        {
          question: 'Be Bold',
          answer: `**What Meta Looks For**:
- Taking calculated risks
- Proposing big ideas, not incremental improvements
- Learning from bold failures
- Not being afraid to challenge the status quo

**STAR Example**:

**Situation**: "Our team was making small, incremental improvements to a legacy system. Progress was slow and no one was excited."

**Task**: "I believed we should rebuild from scratch, but that was risky and controversial."

**Action**:
- "Built a prototype of the new approach on my own time"
- "Demonstrated 5x performance improvement with cleaner architecture"
- "Proposed a 6-week rewrite to leadership with clear risk mitigation"
- "Volunteered to lead the effort and own the outcome"

**Result**: "Got approval for the rewrite. Delivered in 7 weeks with the promised improvements. The bold bet paid off, and the team's morale improved dramatically."

**Key Phrase**: "If we only make safe bets, we'll only get safe results."`

      principles: ['Growth Mindset', 'Customer Obsessed', 'Diverse and Inclusive', 'One Microsoft', 'Making a Difference'],

      introduction: `Microsoft's cultural transformation under Satya Nadella centers on Growth Mindset—the belief that abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work. Expect questions about learning from failure, embracing feedback, and collaborating across teams (One Microsoft). Show intellectual curiosity and humility.`,

      keyQuestions: [
        {
          question: 'Growth Mindset',
          answer: `**What Microsoft Looks For**:
- Learning from failures, not hiding them
- Embracing challenges as growth opportunities
- Seeking and acting on feedback
- Believing that skills can be developed

**STAR Example**:

**Situation**: "I received feedback that my code reviews were too harsh and discouraging junior developers."

**Task**: "I needed to change my approach while maintaining high standards."

**Action**:
- "First, I had to accept the feedback was valid—my intention didn't match my impact"
- "Asked colleagues for specific examples so I could understand the pattern"
- "Studied how respected mentors gave constructive feedback"
- "Started framing reviews as questions rather than criticisms"
- "Added explicit praise for what was done well, not just what needed change"

**Result**: "Over 6 months, my review feedback scores improved significantly. Junior developers started requesting my reviews. I learned that being right isn't enough—how you communicate matters as much as what you say."

**Key Phrase**: "Feedback is a gift. Even when it's hard to hear, it's an opportunity to improve."`
        },
        {
          question: 'One Microsoft',
          answer: `**What Microsoft Looks For**:
- Collaborating across teams and organizations
- Putting company success over team success
- Breaking down silos
- Sharing knowledge and resources

**STAR Example**:

**Situation**: "My team had built an internal tool that could benefit other teams, but sharing it wasn't in our objectives."

**Task**: "I saw an opportunity to help the company but had to make the case for investing time in sharing."

**Action**:
- "Documented the tool and created easy onboarding guides"
- "Reached out to teams with similar problems and offered demos"
- "Set up a support channel and committed to helping early adopters"
- "Made the case to my manager: helping others succeed helps Microsoft succeed"

**Result**: "The tool was adopted by 15 teams across 3 organizations. Total engineering hours saved: an estimated 10,000 per year. My manager highlighted this as an example of One Microsoft culture."

**Key Phrase**: "We win as a company, not as individual teams. Sharing success makes everyone stronger."`
        },
        {
          question: 'Customer Obsessed',
          answer: `**What Microsoft Looks For**:
- Deep understanding of customer problems
- Building FOR customers, not just AT them
- Measuring success by customer outcomes
- Being responsive to customer feedback

**STAR Example**:

**Situation**: "Our product team was planning features based on internal roadmap priorities, not customer feedback."

**Task**: "I believed we were building the wrong things and needed to ground our work in customer needs."

**Action**:
- "Set up a customer feedback analysis system"
- "Identified the top 10 customer pain points from support tickets and feedback"
- "Created a presentation showing misalignment between our roadmap and customer needs"
- "Proposed adjusting priorities to address customer pain points first"

**Result**: "Leadership approved a roadmap shift. Customer satisfaction scores increased 25% in the next quarter. More importantly, we established a process for continuously incorporating customer feedback."

**Key Phrase**: "The best products come from deeply understanding customer problems, not from internal brainstorming."`
